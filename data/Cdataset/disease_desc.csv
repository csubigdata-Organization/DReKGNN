102100,"Rosenthal and Kloepfer (1962)described a 'new' syndrome with these three features in 13 persons of 4 generations of a Louisiana black family. Through the courtesy of Kloepfer,McKusick (1971)examined affected members of this family. The corneal leukoma is an epithelial change. The hands, feet, and chin are very large, and the affected persons unusually tall. Although growth hormone assays had not been done, other endocrine studies and x-ray views of the sella turcica gave no indication of pituitary dysfunction. One of the affected females examined had 9 living children. The skin of the hands is unusually soft and has an abnormal dermal ridge pattern, referred to as 'split ridges,' which permits identification of the disorder in children of preclinical age. A possible difference from the usual cutis verticis gyrata is a longitudinal orientation of the skin folds rather than transverse orientation. X-ray features were reported byHarbison and Nice (1971)."
102300,"Restless legs syndrome (RLS) is a neurologic sleep/wake disorder characterized by uncomfortable and unpleasant sensations in the legs that appear at rest, usually at night, inducing an irresistible desire to move the legs. The disorder results in nocturnal insomnia and chronic sleep deprivation (Bonati et al., 2003).Genetic Heterogeneity of Restless Legs SyndromeRLS1 has been mapped to chromosome 12q. Other susceptibility loci for RLS include RLS2 (608831) on chromosome 14q13-q31; RLS3 (610438) on chromosome 9p24-p22; RLS4 (610439) on chromosome 2q33; RLS5 (611242) on chromosome 20p13; RLS6 (611185) on chromosome 6p21; RLS7 (612853) on chromosome 2p14; and RLS8 (615197) on chromosome 5q31."
102400,"Schinz et al. (1951)described dominant inheritance of slowly progressive osteolysis of the phalanges in the hands and feet associated with recurrent ulcers of the fingers and soles, elimination of bone sequestra, and healing with loss of toes or fingers, with onset between 8 and 22 years.Lamy and Maroteaux (1961)described a dominant form in mother and son. Members of 2 earlier generations were also affected. No abnormality of sensation was present.Maroteaux (1970)found no basilar impression or other changes in the skull or long bones to suggest that this was Cheney syndrome (102500).Reed (1974)reported other families.A phenocopy is produced in men working in the polymerization of vinyl chloride (Harris and Adams, 1967;Ross, 1970)."
102500,A number sign (#) is used with this entry because of evidence that Hajdu-Cheney syndrome (HJCYS) is caused by heterozygous mutation in the NOTCH2 gene (600275) on chromosome 1p12.
103100,"A number sign (#) is used with this entry because of evidence that Adie pupil is a characteristic of Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 2J (607736), which is caused by mutation in the MPZ gene (159440)."
103230,"Chuandi et al. (1985)reported a Chinese kindred in which persons in 3 generations, and by implication at least 1 person in a fourth earlier generation, had chronic adrenal insufficiency. This was manifest by hyperpigmentation, hypernatriuria, hypokaliuria, and decreased plasma total cortisol and urine free cortisol; PTC, UFC and 17-OHCS did not respond to ACTH stimulation. Eleven affected persons in 5 sibships were identified, including several instances of male-to-male transmission."
103285,"A number sign (#) is used with this entry because of evidence that ADULT syndrome is caused by heterozygous mutation in the TP63 gene (603273) on chromosome 3q28.Allelic disorders with overlapping features include EEC3 (604292), limb-mammary syndrome (LMS;603543), AEC syndrome (106260), Rapp-Hodgkin syndrome (RHS;129400), and SHFM4 (605289)"

104130,"Shokeir (1977)reported a 4-generation family in which 12 individuals had alopecia universalis and dental pyorrhea resulting in tooth loss. Eight individuals, all in the last 2 generations, also had psychomotor epilepsy and peridontal pyorrhea, and 7 had borderline cognitive function. The proband was a 21-year-old woman who developed seizures at age 18. The seizures were characterized by a sense of unreality, nausea, wandering, and loss of memory without frank loss of consciousness, suggestive of temporal lobe epilepsy. She had an IQ of 72. Microscopic analysis of the proband's hair showed a thin shaft with uneven girth and occasional beading. The inheritance pattern in this family was consistent with autosomal dominant.Shokeir (1977)noted that the affected tissues all derived from the ectoderm. Similar disorders with mental retardation and alopecia, but showing autosomal recessive inheritance, are discussed in203600and203650.Timar et al. (1993)described a 23-month-old boy with a similar disorder to that described byShokeir (1977). He had congenital total permanent alopecia, febrile seizures, purulent conjunctivitis, and mental retardation. The child also had dry skin and a giant pigmented nevus on the left lower back. There were some dysmorphic features, including growth retardation, macrocephaly, facial asymmetry, epicanthal folds, hypertelorism, strabismus, high-arched palate, and distorted dentition of the central incisors. There was no family history, suggesting a de novo event."
104300,"A number sign (#) is used with this entry because of evidence that familial Alzheimer disease-1 (AD1) is caused by heterozygous mutation in the APP gene (104760), which encodes the amyloid precursor protein, on chromosome 21q21.A homozygous mutation in the APP gene with a dominant-negative effect on amyloidogenesis was found in 1 patient with an early-onset progressive dementia and his affected younger sister (104760.0022).A coding single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the APP gene (104760.0023) has been shown to have a protective effect against Alzheimer disease.See also APP-related cerebral amyloid angiopathy (CAA;605714), which shows overlapping clinical and neuropathologic features."

106100,"A number sign (#) is used with this entry because hereditary angioedema-1 and -2 (HAE1 and HAE2), which are clinically indistinguishable but biochemically distinct, are both caused by heterozygous mutation in the C1 inhibitor gene (C1NH; SERPING1;606860) on chromosome 11q. HAE caused by homozygous mutation in the C1NH gene has also been reported."
106400,"Beardwell (1969)described a family of Greek Cypriot extraction in which at least 8 persons in 4 sibships in 2 generations were known to have a combination of ankylosing vertebral hyperostosis and tylosis (see144200). The tylosis was a punctate hyperkeratosis of the soles and palms. In addition, 6 persons had tylosis alone; thus, these may have been 2 independent genetic traits in this kindred. (This condition is sometimes called Forestier disease, although Forestier described senile ankylosing hyperostosis (Forestier and Rotes-Querol, 1950) and, before Beardwell's paper, familial occurrence had never been noted.) The family contained instances of male-to-male transmission. No member had the spinal disease without tylosis. No further families were known toBeardwell (1978). Involvement of the appendicular skeleton was recognized byResnick et al. (1975), who proposed the designation diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis (DISH). The prevalence of DISH was studied in various population groups byUtsinger (1985). Although DISH was thought to be less common in American blacks as compared to Caucasians,Cassim et al. (1990)found it rather frequent among hospitalized blacks in Africa."
107320,"The designation 'antiphospholipid syndrome' was proposed for the association of arterial and venous thrombosis, recurrent fetal loss, and immune thrombocytopenia with a spectrum of autoantibodies directed against cellular phospholipid components. Anticardiolipin antibodies may react with cardiolipin and with other negatively charged phospholipids, including beta-2-glycoprotein I (B2GPI, APOH;138700). The term 'lupus anticoagulant' refers to a heterogeneous group of antibodies, most commonly of the IgG type, that are detected by their inhibitory effect on coagulant-active phospholipid components of in vitro coagulation tests (summary byMatthey et al., 1989).Shoenfeld et al. (2008)noted that antiphospholipid syndrome is characterized by up to 30 different autoantibodies, including those against platelets, glycoproteins, coagulation factors, lamins, mitochondrial antigens, and cell surface markers. Some of these may have an additive effect on the prothrombotic tendency of the syndrome.Ruiz-Irastorza et al. (2010)reviewed pathophysiologic, clinical, diagnostic, and therapeutic advances related to the antiphospholipid syndrome.Various autoimmune disorders that cluster in families, including autoimmune thrombocytopenia (188030), are discussed elsewhere (e.g.,109100,269200)."
107550,"Levin et al. (1973)described monozygotic female twins with a syndrome of hypoplasia or interruption of the transverse aortic arch, facial weakness involving particularly the depressor anguli oris, and bilateral retinal coloboma.Marden and Venters (1966)described macular coloboma and coarctation of the aorta in a single patient who also had the linear nevus sebaceous syndrome. Whether this is a genuine syndrome and, if so, whether it is mendelian is not clear."
107650,"Obstructive sleep apnea is a common, chronic, complex disease associated with serious cardiovascular and neuropsychologic sequelae and with substantial social and economic costs (Palmer et al., 2003)."
109100,"A number sign (#) is used with this entry because it relates to a category of disorders.In many of the disorders in which autoimmunity has been incriminated, or at least accused, as a leading etiologic factor, familial aggregation is observed. For example, see thyroid autoantibodies (140300), alopecia areata (104000), pernicious anemia (170900), hypoadrenocorticism with hypoparathyroidism and superficial moniliasis (240300), Schmidt syndrome (269200), systemic lupus erythematosus (152700), Sjogren syndrome (270150), and anemia, autoimmune hemolytic (205700). The genetic significance of this is unclear. It is possible that if maternal antithyroid antibodies are responsible for athyreotic cretinism, then multiple sibs might be affected by this congenital anomaly without any genetic basis. Reports on the aggregation of possible autoimmune disorders include the following:Greenberg (1964)described 2 sisters with myasthenia gravis and thyrotoxicosis and a third sister with Hashimoto struma.Pirofsky (1968)found that 20% of 44 patients with idiopathic autoimmune hemolytic anemia had close relatives with clinically detectable autoimmune disease.Karpatkin et al. (1981)described a family in which the mother and 3 of her 4 children (a son and 2 daughters) had autoimmune thrombocytopenia purpura with bound platelet antibody. The 4 affected persons shared an HLA haplotype: A1, C-, B8, DR3 and Dw3.Lippman et al. (1982)found a high frequency of autoimmune manifestations, both clinical and laboratory, in relatives of a proband with autoimmune hemolytic anemia, 1 with immune thrombocytopenic purpura and 8 with systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE;152700). Segregation analysis was most compatible with an autosomal dominant pattern. The odds against linkage to HLA were 100:1.Bias et al. (1983)suggested that autoimmunity is an autosomal dominant trait. They studied 2 large kindreds in which serologic abnormalities as well as overt autoimmune disease were used in the definition of the autoimmune phenotype. Linkage studies in a second series of 23 families excluded linkage with HLA, Gm, and Km. The only positive score was with MNS (0.78 at theta = 0.30).Cales et al. (1983)studied the family of 2 brothers with primary biliary cirrhosis. Granulomatous hepatitis associated with autoimmune thyroiditis was found in a sister. Immunologic abnormalities were found in 6 members of the family: antinuclear antimitochondrial and antithyroid autoantibodies and rheumatoid factor. In a study of 6 families of probands with primary Sjogren syndrome (270150),Reveille et al. (1984)found various other autoimmune diseases and autoantibodies.Maclaren and Riley (1986)found that autoimmune Addison disease was strongly associated with HLA-DR3 and DR4; relative risks were 6.0, 4.6, and 26.5 for DR3, DR4, and DR3/DR4, respectively. This is similar to the findings for insulin-dependent diabetes. Patients with type I autoimmune polyglandular syndrome did not show the association.Bias et al. (1986)suggested that although autoimmune diseases show a distribution in families consistent with multifactorial etiology, the autoimmune trait is defined by the presence of autoimmune disease and/or high titer autoantibody as a familial occurrence consistent with autosomal dominant inheritance. They analyzed 18 autoimmune kindreds, concluding that the population frequency of the postulated autoimmune gene is approximately 0.10 with penetrance estimates of 92% in females and 49% in males. They proposed the existence of a primary autoimmune disease gene that is epistatic to other secondary genes that influence the autoimmune phenotype, including those of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). The secondary genes, according to their hypothesis, confer specificity to the phenotype. (See comments ofGrundbacher (1988)and ofBias (1988).)Adams and Knight (1980)suggested that autoimmunity results from somatic mutations permitting the emergence of 'forbidden clones' of immunocytes.Reveille et al. (1989)described a father and son with polyarteritis nodosa (PAN) following hepatitis B infection. Further study of the family showed that the spouse of the father had long-standing SLE, a 38-year-old maternal uncle had had seropositive nodular rheumatoid arthritis since age 10, a 30-year-old maternal aunt had had seropositive rheumatoid arthritis since age 13, and a 68-year-old maternal aunt had rheumatoid factor-negative rheumatoid-like polyarthritis associated with xerophthalmia. The 75-year-old paternal grandmother had had idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura, and a 69-year-old paternal great aunt had a 10-year history of seropositive nodular rheumatoid arthritis. Transmission of hepatitis in this family was thought to be due to the sharing of a razor. No correlation with a specific HLA haplotype could be demonstrated.Epplen (1992)discussed autoimmunity from the perspective of evolution. The immune system furnished the organism with the utmost effective defense mechanisms against 'foreign' or 'nonself' as well as against changes in 'self' without doing self-harm. Optimized efficacy in the defense against the immense variety of foreign antigens generates a higher risk for inadvertent self challenge--what in the military would be referred to as the consequences of 'friendly fire.'Mason et al. (1994)described polyarteritis nodosa in an Asian boy who presented at 13 years of age with livedo reticularis, Raynaud phenomenon, arthralgia, and hypertension. At the age of 17, he was shown by arteriography to have multiple small aneurysms of the renal, hepatic, and celiac axis vessels, consistent with a diagnosis of polyarteritis nodosa. He was treated successfully with prednisolone and immunosuppressive agents but pursued a relapsing, intermittent course, the relapses being associated with recurrence of a positive perinuclear antinucleophil cytoplasmic antibody test. His sister was admitted to the hospital at age 17 with fever and epigastric pain and showed palpable nodules over both temporal arteries, marked livedo reticularis, and hypertension. The parents were first cousins. A sib had died at the age of 9 within 24 hours of collapsing suddenly. Autopsy demonstrated a ruptured superficial vessel in the posterior part of the left frontal lobe. The father, having recently been diagnosed as hypertensive, collapsed and died suddenly at the age of 44 years while traveling abroad. Despite their consanguinity, the parents shared no HLA haplotypes. The 2 sibs with proven PAN shared 1 HLA haplotype derived from the mother.Becker et al. (1998)compared linkage results from 23 published genomewide scans in autoimmune or immune-mediated diseases. Human diseases included multiple sclerosis, Crohn disease, familial psoriasis, asthma, and type I diabetes (IDDM). Experimental animal disease studies included mouse experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis, rat inflammatory arthritis, rat and mouse IDDM, histamine sensitization, immunity to exogenous antigens, and mouse lupus. A majority (approximately 65%) of the human positive linkages mapped nonrandomly into 18 distinct clusters. Overlapping of susceptibility loci occurred between different human immune diseases and by comparing conserved regions with experimental autoimmune/immune disease models. This nonrandom clustering supported a hypothesis that, in some cases, clinically distinct autoimmune diseases may be controlled by a common set of susceptibility genes. The clusters occurred on 18 of the 22 autosomes and on the X chromosome.Pando et al. (1999)studied class II major histocompatibility complex types in children and adults with type I autoimmune hepatitis in Argentina. They found that different HLA-DRB1 (142857) allotypes confer susceptibility to autoimmune hepatitis in children and adults, raising the possibility that the pediatric and adult forms of the disorder may be triggered by different factors.For information on an autoimmune disease susceptibility locus on chromosome 1p31, see AIS1 (607836)."
109200,"Androgenetic alopecia is characterized by a loss of hair from the scalp that follows a defined pattern (Hamilton, 1951). It occurs in women as well as in men. It is caused by a shortening of the anagen (growth) phase and miniaturization of the hair follicle, which results in the formation of progressively thinner, shorter hair (Bergfeld, 1995). In men, the condition is often referred to as male pattern baldness (MPB) and appears to be androgen-dependent (Hamilton, 1942). The condition is hereditary, and follows a pattern that may be consistent with an autosomal dominant trait (Osborn, 1916).Linkage evidence for an autosomal locus on 3q26 (AGA1) has been identified (Hillmer et al., 2008). See300710(AGA2) for a discussion of X linkage of androgenetic alopecia. A third locus has been found on chromosome 20p11 (AGA3;612421)."
109350,"Gastroesophageal reflux (GER) is characterized by the retrograde movement of stomach contents into the esophagus. In its most severe form, GER results in extensive tissue damage caused by acid reflux. In adolescents and adults, and even infrequently in children, chronic GER is associated with the risk of developing Barrett metaplasia (614266), a premalignant lesion of the esophageal mucosa (Hu et al., 2000). In turn, Barrett metaplasia is correlated with the development of adenocarcinoma of the esophagus (see614266), estimated as the fifth most prevalent neoplasia in the Western world (Lagergren et al., 1999)."

109800,"A number sign (#) is used with this entry because bladder cancer is a complex disorder with both genetic and environmental influences. Somatic mutations in several genes, e.g., HRAS (190020), KRAS2 (190070), RB1 (614041), and FGFR3 (134934), have been implicated in bladder carcinogenesis. SeeBishop (1982)for a discussion of oncogenes."
110100,"A number sign (#) is used with this entry because blepharophimosis, ptosis, and epicanthus inversus syndrome, either with premature ovarian failure (BPES type I) or without (BPES type II), is caused by heterozygous mutation in the FOXL2 gene (605597) on chromosome 3q22. Rare instances of homozygous mutation in the FOXL2 gene have been reported."
113610,"De Yebenes et al. (1988)described a syndrome of branchial myoclonus, spastic paraparesis, and cerebellar ataxia in 6 members of 2 generations of a family that lived in the province of Toledo in Spain. Male-to-male transmission occurred. Rhythmic myoclonus involving the palate, pharynx, larynx, and face was followed by truncal ataxia and spastic paraparesis. Age of onset ranged from 40 to 50 years. Computerized tomography and magnetic resonance imaging showed mild atrophy of the cerebral and cerebellar cortex and severe atrophy of the medulla and spinal cord. The pons appeared normal, and the olives did not seem hypertrophic. Reduction of the serotonin metabolite 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid was found in the cerebrospinal fluid. Treatment with 5-hydroxytryptophan and carbidopa at maximal tolerated doses improved ataxia mildly but did not modify the myoclonus. Treatment with other agents was unsuccessful. The clinical symptoms were progressive, leading to death or severe disability 5 to 10 years after onset of the disease. Branchial myoclonus is rare but has been observed with a variety of disorders including demyelinating disease, infarction, arteritis, neoplasm, and trauma involving the lower brainstem or the dentato-rubro-olivary pathways.Sperling and Herrmann (1985),Leger et al. (1986), andSasaki et al. (1987)described branchial myoclonus in patients with spinocerebellar degeneration and olivopontocerebellar atrophy, butde Yebenes et al. (1988)thought that the disorder in their family was different from that reported in any of these 3 publications.Howard et al. (1993)described a Kuwaiti family that came to attention because of 2 sisters and a brother, out of a sibship of 10, who presented with a progressive neurologic disorder beginning in the third decade of life that was characterized by palatal myoclonus, nystagmus, bulbar weakness, and spastic tetraparesis. There was no evidence of intellectual deterioration or seizures. CT scan showed marked brainstem atrophy in 2 patients and basal ganglia calcification in 1. MRI scan in 1 showed high signal in the brainstem and periventricular region, and cerebral biopsy in this patient showed myelin loss and the presence of Rosenthal fibers, which are particularly characteristic of Alexander disease (203450). A similar disease affected the mother, who died at age 45, a maternal aunt, who died at age 50, and 2 daughters of the aunt who were still living.Howard et al. (1993)suggested autosomal dominant inheritance. It may be noteworthy that the parents of the 3 sibs were consanguineous, as were also the parents of the 'mother' and 'maternal aunt.' Palatal myoclonus, which also occurs in Machado-Joseph disease (109150) and in spinocerebellar ataxia type 2 (183090), is characterized by rhythmic oscillations of the soft palate. It is also called branchial myoclonus because it may be associated with synchronous contractions of muscles derived from the branchial arches, including the diaphragm, tongue, and sternomastoids."
113800,A number sign (#) is used with this entry because of evidence that epidermolytic hyperkeratosis (EHK) is caused by heterozygous mutation in the keratin-1 gene (KRT1;139350) on chromosome 12q13.
114480,"A number sign (#) is used with this entry because of evidence that mutation at more than one locus can be involved in different families or even in the same case. Breast-ovarian cancer-1 (BROVCA1;604370) can be caused by mutation in the BRCA1 gene (113705) on chromosome 17q, BROVCA2 (600185) by mutation in the BRCA2 gene (612555) on chromosome 13q12, BROVCA3 (613399) by mutation in the RAD51C gene (602774) on chromosome 17q22, and BROVCA4 (614291) by mutation in the RAD51D gene (602954) on chromosome 17q11.Mutation in the androgen receptor gene (AR;313700) on the X chromosome has been found in cases of male breast cancer (see313700.0016).Mutation in the RAD51 gene (179617) has been found in patients with familial breast cancer (179617.0001). Breast cancer susceptibility alleles have been reported in the CHEK2 gene (see604373.0001and604373.0012) and in the BARD1 gene (see601593.0001).Furthermore, the PPM1D gene (605100) on 17q is commonly amplified in breast cancer and appears to lead to cell transformation by abrogating p53 (191170) tumor suppressor activity (Bulavin et al., 2002). Somatic mutations in the following genes have been identified in breast cancer: SLC22A18 (602631) on 11p15, TP53 (191170) on 17p13, RB1CC1 (606837) on 8q11, PIK3CA (171834) on 3q26, and AKT1 (164730) on 14q32.An allele of the CASP8 gene (601763.0003) has been associated with reduced risk of breast cancer. An allele of the TGFB1 gene (190180.0007) has been associated with an increased risk of invasive breast cancer. An allele of the NQO1 gene (125860.0001) has been associated with breast cancer prognosis, including survival after chemotherapy and after metastasis. Variation in the HMMR gene (600936) has also been shown to modify susceptibility.Mutations in genes responsible for various forms of Fanconi anemia (see, e.g.,227650) have been identified as susceptibility factors for breast cancer. These include BRCA2, PALB2 (610355), BRIP1 (605882), and RAD51C (602774).Breast cancer is a feature of several cancer syndromes, including Li-Fraumeni syndrome (151623) due to germline mutations in p53; Cowden syndrome (158350) due to mutations in the PTEN gene (601728); and Peutz-Jeghers syndrome (175200) due to mutations in the STK11 gene (602216). There also appears to be an increased risk of breast and ovarian cancer in ataxia-telangiectasia (208900), and there is some evidence that heterozygotes for some mutations in the ataxia-telangiectasia mutated gene (ATM; e.g.,607585.0032) have an increased risk of breast cancer. Germline and somatic mutations in the CDH1 gene (192090) have been found in diffuse gastric and lobular breast cancer syndrome (DBLBC;137215).Some genomic regions have been found to be amplified in breast cancer, including 8q24, 20q13, 11q12, and 8p12-p11 (Yang et al., 2006). The NCOA3 (601937) and ZNF217 (602967) genes, located on 20q, undergo amplification in breast cancer; when overexpressed, these genes confer cellular phenotypes consistent with a role in tumor formation (Anzick et al., 1997;Collins et al., 1998)."

These include TP53 (191170), MET (164860), CTNNB1 (116806), PIK3CA (171834), AXIN1 (603816), and APC (611731).See142330for familial hepatic adenoma, sometimes associated with hepatocellular carcinoma."
114580,"Chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis (CMC) includes a group of rare disorders with altered immune responses, selective against Candida, characterized by persistent and/or recurrent infections of the skin, nails, and mucous membranes, caused by organisms of the genus Candida, mainly Candida albicans (Zuccarello et al., 2002).Isolated familial chronic mucocutaneous candidiasis is distinct from candidiasis with endocrinopathy (240300).In myeloperoxidase deficiency (254600), susceptibility to candidiasis may be increased.Genetic Heterogeneity of CandidiasisFamilial candidiasis-1 (CANDF1) maps to chromosome 2p. CANDF2 (212050) is caused by mutation in the CARD9 gene (607212) on chromosome 9q34.3. CANDF3 (607644), a form restricted to nails of the hands and feet, maps to chromosome 11. CANDF4 (613108) is caused by mutation in the CLEC7A gene (606264) on chromosome 12p13. CANDF6 (613956) is caused by mutation in the IL17F gene (606496) on chromosome 6p12. CANDF7 (614162) is caused by mutation in the STAT1 gene (600555) on chromosome 2q32. CANDF8 (615527) is caused by mutation in the TRAF3IP2 gene (607043) on chromosome 6q21. CANDF9 (616445) is caused by mutation in the IL17RC gene (610925) on chromosome 3p25.A form of familial candidiasis, previously thought to be isolated and designated CANDF5, has been found to be part of a primary immune deficiency (IMD51;613953) that includes Staphylococcal skin infections and increased susceptibility to chronic bacterial respiratory infections."

115645,"Wellesley et al. (1991)described a mother and 2 children, a boy and a girl, with short stature, cataracts, and aberrant oral frenula. The mother was 150 cm tall (less than the 3rd centile) and had had cataracts removed in early adulthood. The boy had left ptosis with hypermetropia, and bilateral posterior polar cataracts were removed at the age of 3 years. His facial changes consisted of epicanthal folds.

In 2 autopsied members of the family, neuropathologic correlations consisted of extracellular hyaline eosinophilic, congophilic amyloid plaques in the cerebral cortex, basal ganglia, thalamus, and substantia nigra, in descending order of frequency, as well as atrophy and gliosis of the basal ganglia and substantia nigra. The extracellular plaque did not stain with antibody raised against the prion protein or with 2 separate anti-amyloid A4 antibodies. Although no instance of male-to-male transmission was identified in the family, the inheritance was thought to be autosomal dominant. Both Alzheimer disease and Gerstmann-Straussler syndrome could be excluded by the properties of the amyloid."
125600,"Although nothing is clearly established about the genetics of this disorder, the occurrence predominantly in blacks is consistent with a genetic basis. As many as 35% of adult blacks may be affected. The disorder is somewhat more frequent in females. The papules occur most typically on the face below the eyes and on the cheeks.Castellani (1925)described and named this disorder, which he found to be very frequent among the blacks of Jamaica and Central America. The lesions are black and dark-brown papules, sometimes cupoliform or at times flattened; they are situated on the face, principally on both malar regions, being rare or absent on the lower parts of the face and chin. Onset is usually about the time of puberty.Butterworth and Strean (1962)expressed the opinion that this condition is merely a variant of seborrheic keratoses that occurs predominantly in blacks."

The comorbidity of the 2 disorders suggests that presence of PPR may also increase the risk for epilepsy (Stephani et al., 2004;Tauer et al., 2005).Genetic Heterogeneity of Photoparoxysmal ResponseThe PPR1 locus has been mapped to chromosome 6p21.

132300,"Rowan et al. (1970)described a girl who had major and minor seizures that were related to pattern and photosensitivity. The mother also had EEG discharges during reading. The daughter's attacks were precipitated by television-viewing. A younger sister had had one febrile convulsion. The father had had epilepsy between ages 5 and 8 years. No studies of him were reported.Daly and Forster (1975)diagnosed primary reading epilepsy by special electroencephalographic studies in a 16-year-old youth after his first grand mal seizure. Adolescence is the usual age of onset. The seizure occurred while he was reading the sports page of a newspaper, but for about a year he had experienced jaw jerking while reading, especially when reading aloud before an audience. Reading epilepsy was diagnosed in a first cousin and in 2 of the proband's sibs. Some members of the family showed the centrencephalic EEG trait (117100). The relation was unclear.

134500,"Hensen et al. (1965)described a family in which 8 persons in 4 generations in an autosomal dominant pattern had factor VIII deficiency, normal bleeding times, and lack of factor VIII elevation after infusion of hemophilic plasma.Veltkamp et al. (1968)confirmed these findings and found that no rise of factor VIII occurred in a boy or a woman with hemophilia A when transfused with plasma from a girl in Hensen's family. In a restudy of Hensen's family,Veltkamp and Van Tilburg (1974)found that a member of the family showed de novo synthesis of factor VIII after transfusion with either normal or hemophilic cryoprecipitate, a finding consistent with von Willebrand disease. The authors concluded that 'autosomal hemophilia' is merely a variant of von Willebrand disease.Graham et al. (1975)described a kindred in which hemophilia A, in every way typical, was observed in grandmother, mother and daughter. Factor VIII values were 2 to 4%. Unusual lyonization in females heterozygous for the X-linked disorder was rejected on probabilistic grounds. A previously unrecognized mutation at the von Willebrand locus was considered. Dominant mutation at a fourth (and previously unknown) locus involved in factor VIII synthesis and control was considered possible. Autosomal recessive transmission of hemophilia A is observed with some mutations in the von Willebrand factor gene (e.g.,193400.0011), which result in defective binding of factor VIII; this has been referred to as the Normandy type of hemophilia A."

134520,"Soff et al. (1981)reported 4 families with combined deficiency of coagulation factors VIII, IX and XI. Family 1 had several persons with dislocations, e.g., of patella and hips, and several who had possible hemarthrosis related to trauma. Other probands were referred because of the finding of prolonged partial thromboplastin time (PTT) on preoperative testing. Two generations were affected in 2 families, and males and females had similar procoagulant levels and histories of abnormal hemostasis. No male-to-male transmission was observed. The pathogenesis of FMFD V is unknown. The 3 factors are biochemically and functionally different and the possibility of a common precursor or subunit is highly unlikely. Possibly a common regulator is deficient.Angelopoulos et al.

137400,"Turpin and Caratzali (1936)concluded that the same gene is responsible for both geographic tongue and fissured tongue.Dawson and Pielou (1967)observed 18 persons with geographic tongue, some of whom also had fissured tongue, in 3 generations with probable autosomal dominant pattern. Under the designation 'scrotal tongue,'Tobias (1945)reported 2 families, one with 2 generations and the other with 4 generations affected. Geographic tongue was an associated feature in the proband of 1 family.Seiler (1936)assembled the most extensive pedigree data supporting autosomal dominant inheritance.Kullaa-Mikkonen (1988)studied the genetics of fissured tongue in 31 families. An in vivo method of stereomicroscopy was used for examining the dorsum of the tongue. It was concluded that fissured tongue with smooth-surfaced papillae is transmitted as a dominant with incomplete penetrance and is preceded by geographic tongue. The severity of fissured tongue increases with age. Tongue fissuring with normal-appearing filiform papillae was found not to be familial and was not associated with geographic tongue. In the view ofKullaa-Mikkonen (1988), fissuring with normal papillary structure should be considered a variation of normal anatomy, whereas fissured and geographic tongue is a clinical and etiologic disease entity. The tongue is furrowed and grooved in about 5% of the normal population (Gorlin, 1982)."

144650,"A number sign (#) is used with this entry because of evidence that type V hyperlipoproteinemia can be caused by mutations in the APOA5 gene (606368).Type V of Fredrickson is characterized by increased amounts of chylomicrons and very low density lipoprotein (VLDL) and decreased LDL and high density lipoprotein (HDL) in the plasma after a fast. Numerous conditions cause this phenotype, including insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, contraceptive steroids, alcohol abuse, and glycogen storage disease I (232200). Features include bouts of abdominal pain and eruptive xanthoma.Fredrickson and Lees (1966)observed parental consanguinity, suggesting recessive inheritance.Nagasaka et al. (2003)described 2 unrelated premature females with transient type V hyperlipidemia and low lipoprotein lipase (LPL;238600) activity at 1 to 2 months of age without deficiencies of LPL or apoCII (608083) proteins or detectable inhibitors and without mutations in the LPL or APOC2 genes. The authors postulated the presence of an unidentified LPL inhibitor, perhaps a maternal factor such as estrogen.While genetic factors account for a large proportion of the rare type I hyperlipidemia (238600), the complex interaction between genetics and environment is only partly understood in the more common type V hyperlipidemia.Marcais et al. (2005)reported what they considered to be a new form of familial hyperchylomicronemia with vertical transmission, late onset, incomplete penetrance, and an unusual resistance to conventional treatment. They identified a Q139X truncating mutation in the APOA5 gene (606368.0001) as the determinant of this dyslipidemia based on the following: (a) observation in 2 pedigrees that hyperchylomicronemia occurred only in the Q139X carriers and cosegregated with the Q139X mutant allele in 1 pedigree; (b) presence in the carriers of the 15-kD peptide corresponding to the N-terminal end of APOA5, as expected for a truncation at residue 139; and (c) altered association of wildtype APOA5 to plasma lipoproteins in all of the carriers from both families. Additionally, they demonstrated that severe hypertriglyceridemia in Q139X mutation carriers resulted from an LPL defect leading to lipolysis impairment. In both of the families studied, the dyslipidemia occurred exclusively in the Q139X carriers, none of whom had an identifiable deleterious mutation in the second APOA5 allele. This initially suggested that Q139X causes a dominant hyperchylomicronemia. Subsequent study of the second family indicated that the Q139X heterozygous genotype was incompletely penetrant, with only 2 out of 6 carriers affected. The role for compound heterozygosity with either the S19W mutation of APOA5 (606368.0002) or the APOA5*2 haplotype was indicated by the complete association of hyperchylomicronemia with these compound heterozygote genotypes.Marcais et al. (2005)showed that severe hyperchylomicronemia in homozygote and heterozygote Q139X carriers was caused by profound LPL defect, and they provided what appeared to be the first clear evidence in humans of a functional interplay between APOA5 and LPL."

145590,"Farmer (1989)described an unusual peculiarity in 3 generations of his own family. Although the 'disorder' was not life-threatening or seriously debilitating, it was a major annoyance. The informant, his mother, and a son (1 of his 5 children) experienced episodic increases in skin temperature associated with low or normal oral temperatures. The increased skin temperature was accompanied by severe headache, predominantly around the eyes, forehead and temples, and usually by nausea. The headache was aggravated by light. Vomiting often occurred late in the attack. The symptoms typically lasted for a few hours. Attacks often occurred when the subject was confined in a warm room with poor air circulation or was playing or sitting in the sun. The oldest affected member of the family, the grandmother, had onset at puberty and had not had attacks after hysterectomy at age 51. Her son first remembered symptoms at age 6, although the episodes became more frequent in his twenties. The grandson had onset at about age 5. Aspirin taken after the increase in skin temperature but before the onset of headache and nausea controlled the symptoms. Aspirin and caffeine partially relieved the symptoms after the headache had begun. The condition may be one of abnormal vasodilation at the skin surface leading to a higher skin temperature and lower internal temperature. Vasodilation may account for the headaches."

146850,"Immune suppression may be merely the 'other side of the coin' from immune response.Sasazuki et al. (1980)proposed linkage between HLA and a dominant gene at a locus Is (immune suppression), which suppresses in vitro lymphoproliferative response to streptococcal cell wall antigen. A lod score of +3.2 was observed in 7 families for linkage of the postulated locus with HLA. Although no recombinants were observed, pleiotropism was considered unlikely because no significant association between low responders and HLA specificities was found in the random population. The gene presumably controls the generation of suppressor T cells. The existence of such cells was demonstrated in man byMcMichael and Sasazuki (1977), using the mixed lymphocyte response (MLR) system;Engleman et al.

151590,"Lichen sclerosus et atrophicus is a relatively uncommon cutaneous disorder that may affect any area. There is a particular predilection, however, for involvement of the female genitalia. Although typically the patient is a middle-aged female, prepubertal females may also develop this disorder.Shirer and Ray (1987)stated that about 18 cases of familial LSA had been reported. They concluded that 'heredity plays a role in some, if not all, cases.' They and others reported instances of affected mother-daughter pairs. The eruption of LSA consists of ivory-colored, polygonal, flat-topped lichenoid papules. These papules may coalesce into plaques, which then become atrophic. Adults with vulvar LSA may have an increased risk of developing squamous cell carcinoma of the vulva. Carcinoma has not been known to occur in extragenital lesions.Friedrich and MacLaren (1984)found 13 instances of familial lichen sclerosis in the literature and added 2 families.Clay et al. (1994)found an association between lichen sclerosis and a specific variable number tandem repeat (VNTR) polymorphism in intron 2 of the gene encoding interleukin-1 receptor antagonist (IL1RN;147679).Oyama et al. (2003)noted that HLA-subtype susceptibility and high rates of other autoimmune disorders suggest that autoantibodies to specific mucocutaneous antigens may be involved in the etiology of lichen sclerosis. The clinicopathologic similarities between lichen sclerosis and lipoid proteinosis (247100), which results from mutations in the ECM1 gene (602201), suggested that this protein may be an autoantigen in lichen sclerosis. By immunoblotting, IgG autoantibodies to ECM1 were found in 20 of 30 lichen sclerosis serum samples. The highest titer was 1 in 20. These samples, and those from 56 other patients with lichen sclerosis, showed immunoreactivity to the recombinant ECM1 protein; 6 of 85 control serum samples were positive. The findings suggested that specific humeral immune response to ECM1 may be involved in the etiology of lichen sclerosis and may offer help in disease diagnosis, monitoring, and approaches to treatment."

157700,"Mitral valve prolapse (MVP) has a prevalence of approximately 2 to 3% in the general population. It is characterized by fibromyxomatous changes in mitral leaflet tissue, with upward displacement of 1 or both leaflets into the left atrium during systole; MVP is diagnosed when the movement of the mitral leaflets exceeds 2 mm. In classic MVP, leaflets are at least 5 mm thick, whereas in nonclassic MVP, they are less than 5 mm thick. Auscultatory findings, when present, consist of a midsystolic click and/or a late systolic murmur. The natural history of MVP varies from benign, with a normal life expectancy, to severe complications associated with the development of significant mitral regurgitation, including congestive heart failure, bacterial endocarditis, atrial fibrillation, thromboembolism, and even sudden death. However, complications are uncommon, affecting less than 3% of individuals with MVP (Freed et al., 1999;Grau et al., 2007;Delling and Vasan, 2014).Grau et al.

157950,"Secondary retention is the cessation of eruption of a tooth after emergence that does not result from a physical barrier in the path of eruption or an abnormal position of the tooth. Permanent molars are less frequently affected than deciduous molars. The major characteristic of a secondarily retained molar is infraocclusion, which may result in malocclusion because of tilting of the neighboring teeth and overeruption of antagonists. The disorder can also result in loss of the retained molar and neighboring teeth due to caries and periodontal disease and in deformation of the facial skeleton (Raghoebar et al., 1992).See also125350and273050for phenotypes with shared features of secondary retention of permanent molars."
158280,"Although motion sickness is not likely to be mendelian, it appears to show familial aggregation. Hence, the hypothesis ofTreisman (1977)is of interest. The hypothesis is based on the idea that 'motion sickness is triggered by difficulties which arise in the programming of movements of the eyes or head when the relations between the spatial frameworks...are repeatedly and unpredictably perturbed. Such perturbations may be produced by certain types of motion, or by disturbances in sensory input or motor control produced by ingested toxins.' In nature the last would be important. Emesis in response to motion is viewed by this hypothesis as an unfortunate accidental byproduct of the system to get rid of neurotoxins."
160300,"Magee and DeJong (1965)reported a family in which 18 members over 5 generations developed bilateral foot drop by the age of 2 years. A mild paresis of extension of the fingers and occasionally mild weakness of the hands developed later in some of the affected members. The course was slowly progressive during childhood with intermittent long stationary periods. There was no obvious progression of the disorder.Van der Does de Willebois et al. (1968)described a father and 2 sons with distal myopathy beginning with bilateral foot drop at about 2 years of age. There was little to no progression of the disorder. Electromyographic investigations showed myopathic features in the muscles involved. No marked weakness or electromyographic abnormalities were present in the peroneal muscles. Because the myopathy became apparent when the patients began to walk, the authors suggested that the disorder may be a congenital myopathy."
160750,"Lewkonia and Buxton (1973)described myositis in father and daughter. The daughter's illness resembled childhood dermatomyositis and progressed to systemic involvement with death less than 4 years after onset. The father's illness followed the course of adult polymyositis, with little evidence of systemic involvement. Proximal muscle weakness was a conspicuous feature in both. In both, the diagnosis of myositis was confirmed by muscle biopsy. The significance of the familial occurrence may be similar to that of familial SLE (152700) and familial autoimmune disorders (109100).Rider et al. (1998)described the clinical, serologic, and immunogenetic features of idiopathic inflammatory myopathy (IIM), observed in 16 unrelated families in which 2 or more blood relatives developed the disorder. In addition, findings in patients with familial IIM were compared with those in 181 patients with sporadic IIM. Families included 3 pairs of monozygotic twins with juvenile dermatomyositis, 11 families with other sibs or relatives with polymyositis or dermatomyositis, and 2 families with inclusion body myositis (147421). They found that the clinical features of familial IIM were similar to those of sporadic IIM, although the frequency of myositis-specific autoantibodies was lower in familial than in sporadic cases. In the HLA system, DRB1*0301 was a common genetic risk factor for familial and sporadic IIM, but contributed less to the genetic risk of familial IIM. Homozygosity at the HLA-DQA1 locus was found to be a genetic risk factor unique to familial IIM.Rider et al. (1998)concluded that familial muscle weakness is not always due to inherited metabolic defects or dystrophies, but may be the result of the development of IIM in several members of the same family, and that multiple genetic factors are probably important in the etiology and disease expression of familial IIM, with DQA1 homozygosity being a distinct risk factor for familial IIM."

All patients presented as adults with hypertension and proteinuria, usually of mild degree. Rheumatoid arthritis was present in several members of the kindred, including some persons without nephritis; in doubly affected persons, it appeared to bear no temporal relationship to the renal disease. None of the affected persons had macroscopic hematuria and only 2 had microscopic hematuria. Extensive renal damage was present in 1 person despite good function.Cohn et al. (2000)reported a large Israeli family of Iraqi Jewish origin with an autosomal dominant form of adult-onset nephropathy and hypertension. There were 14 affected individuals spanning 4 generations. Marked hypertension (diastolic pressure of 105 mm/Hg) was the presenting symptom in all patients. Eleven patients developed end-stage renal disease between ages 19 and 50 years. Seven underwent renal transplantation and 3 were on hemodialysis. Laboratory studies showed increased serum creatinine, but urine analysis was normal, with no evidence of proteinuria. None of the patients had any extrarenal manifestations. Renal biopsy reports were available from 2 patients. One had some sclerotic glomeruli with interstitial fibrosis and mild tubular atrophy. The other showed mild thinning of the membranes without other significant findings. No abnormalities were seen after immunofluorescent staining for IgG, IgA, IgM, C3 (120700), C4 (see120810), C1q (see120550), properdin (300383), fibrinogen (see134820), and albumin (103600).

Most patients had onset of bilateral hearing loss and visual loss with optic atrophy by school-age. Onset of neurologic features occurred only in a subset of patients as adults, and consisted primarily of decreased vibratory sensation and hyporeflexia in the lower limbs. Nerve conduction velocities suggested an axonal sensory and motor neuropathy. The second family had 3 affected members in 3 generations. Optic atrophy was recognized in the first decade of life. The proband had visual loss at school age and hearing loss by age 13 years. Decreased distal sensation developed as an adult.Hagemoser et al.

167870,"The DSM-IV (American Psychiatric Association, 1994) defines panic disorder as the spontaneous, unexpected occurrence of panic attacks followed by persistent concern, worry, and anxiety about having additional panic attacks. Panic attacks are defined as a discrete period of intense fear or discomfort in which at least 4 of 13 symptom criteria are met that develop abruptly and reach a peak within 10 minutes. Some of these criteria include cardiac palpitations, sweating, feelings of choking, fear of losing control, and fear of dying. Panic disorder is divided into panic disorder with or without accompanying agoraphobia. However, agoraphobia can also occur without panic disorder, and panic attacks can occur in the absence of panic disorder. Comorbidity with depressive and addictive disorders is frequent.Barlow et al. (1994)andSmoller and Tsuang (1998)noted that because the diagnostic criteria remain purely clinical, the nosology of anxiety disorders, such as panic disorder, is controversial and evolving. Therefore, it is difficult to do genetic studies because of the difficulty in delineating overlapping phenotypes within the broader context of anxiety disorders. For example, there may be overlap of panic with specific phobias, variable expressivity of panic and anxiety or depression, or phenocopies within a family. The terms 'anxiety neurosis' and 'phobic neurosis' were used in the past (before the DSM-III in 1980) to encompass all of these disorders.Smoller and Tsuang (1998)suggested that dimensional personality traits, such as shyness, behavioral inhibition, and neuroticism (see607834), could be used to define an anxiety phenotype.Schumacher et al. (2011)provided a review of the genetics of panic disorder. They noted that there is high (80%) comorbidity with other psychiatric disorders, including agoraphobia, mood disorders, substance abuse, and other anxiety disorders. Associated personality traits include anxiety sensitivity, behavioral inhibition, neuroticism, and harm avoidance. Women are more susceptible to development of the disorder, which has an average age of onset at 23.6 years.Genetic Heterogeneity of Susceptibility to Panic DisorderSusceptibility to panic disorder-1 (PAND1) has been mapped to chromosome 13q.

Progression was very slow. David B. Clark had seen the disorder in father and daughter (Ford, 1961). The substantia nigra was normal, but degeneration and loss of large cells of the lenticular nuclei occurred. Hunt's second case was the offspring of first cousins. She died at the age of 65 years. Autopsy showed pallidopyramidal disease (PARK15;260300).Allen and Knopp (1976)observed a family with 3 affected females: the proband, her paternal grandmother, and her sister's daughter. The proband's father had died at age 34 years. A disorder of gait ('walking on the ball of the foot') started in the proband at age 6 years and tremor in the hands at age 10. Achilles tenotomy was performed at age 11. In her 30s, striking improvement occurred with L-DOPA and anticholinergic medication. The paternal grandmother had onset of tremors at age 13 years. Flexion dystonia of the fingers and fixed facial expression were evident by age 54. She became immobile and bedridden after age 64 and died at age 80. The niece, aged 15 at time of report, showed dystonic movements of the right hand and a longstanding disturbance of gait. L-DOPA effected improvement.Martin et al.

170900,"In the relatives of 34 pernicious anemia probands,McIntyre et al. (1959)tested the ability to absorb orally given doses of cobalt-60 labeled vitamin B12 (Schilling test). The relatives of pernicious anemia patients showed a negative correlation with age; control subjects did not. The relatives showed a tendency to bimodality. Forty-eight percent of sibs and 32% of offspring had abnormal absorption. The authors suggested autosomal dominant inheritance.Wangel et al. (1968)suggested that the tendency to form autoantibodies against gastric parietal cells may be inherited as a dominant with incomplete penetrance. Later studies (McIntyre, 1968) yielded results that make a simple genetic hypothesis difficult to support.

181460,"The propensity of helminths, such as schistosomes, to immunomodulate the host's immune system is an essential aspect of their survival.Ritter et al. (2010)stimulated mouse bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (BMDCs) with soluble schistosomal egg antigens (SEAs) after prestimulation with different TLR ligands and observed suppressed secretion of Tnf (191160) and Il6 (147620) and increased Nlrp3 (606416)-dependent Il1b (147720) production. Induction of Il1b was phagocytosis-independent, but it required production of reactive oxygen species, potassium efflux, and functional Syk (600085) signaling, suggesting inflammasome activation. SEA stimulation of BMDCs lacking Fcrg (see146740) or dectin-2 (CLEC6A;613579) resulted in significantly reduced Il1b production compared with wildtype BMDCs, suggesting that SEA triggers dectin-2, which couples with Fcrg to activate the Syk kinase signaling pathway that controls Nlrp3 inflammasome activation and Il1b release. Infection of mice lacking Nlrp3 or the central inflammasome adaptor Asc (PYCARD;606838) with S. mansoni resulted in no difference in parasite burden, but decreased liver pathology and downregulated Th1, Th2, and Th17 adaptive immune responses.Ritter et al. (2010)concluded that SEA components induce IL1B production and that NLRP3 plays a crucial role during S. mansoni infection.Smith et al. (2005)identified a molecule produced by Schistosoma eggs, termed S. mansoni chemokine-binding protein (smCKBP), that bound the chemokines CCL2 (158105), CCL3 (182283), CCL5 (187011), CXCL8 (146930), and CX3CL1 (601880). SmCKBP blocked interaction of these chemokines with their receptors and thereby inhibited induction of inflammation.Smith et al. (2005)proposed that since smCKBP is unrelated to host proteins, it may have potential as an antiinflammatory agent. They concluded that smCKBP explains, at least in part, how modulation of the immune system allows the host to tolerate chronic worm infections without overt morbidity."

182280,"Small cell cancer of the lung accounts for about a fourth of the 110,000 new cases of lung cancer that occur annually in the United States. It is clinically distinctive: usually metastases are already present at the time of discovery so that surgery is not used. In contrast to adeno- and squamous carcinoma, SCCL is sensitive to chemotherapy and radiotherapy.Whang-Peng et al. (1982)found a specific, acquired chromosomal abnormality (deletion 3p) in at least one chromosome 3 in all metaphases in all 12 cell lines cultured from human SCCL tissue in 2-day tumor culture specimens from 3 patients. The shortest region of overlap showed the deletion to involve 3p23-p14. No other type of lung cancer showed this deletion, nor did lymphoblastoid lines cultured from SCCL patients whose tumors had the 3p deletion. SCCL is 'caused' by cigarette smoking as are other types of lung cancer. Thus, like chronic myeloid leukemia, this is an example of an exogenously induced malignancy with a specific chromosomal change. Cytogenetic effects of cigarette smoke are relevant in this connection (Madle et al., 1981).Several biochemical markers were found to be associated with small cell cancer of the lung (Gazdar et al., 1981;Tapia et al., 1981). Perhaps genes in the 3p14-23 region have something to do with these markers as well as with the genesis of SCCL. (The cell of origin of SCCL is thought to be the Kulchitsky cell, an argentaffine cell situated in the bronchial epithelium, although this is not proved.)Erisman et al. (1982)showed that SCCL contains bombesin, a tetradecapeptide from anuran skin. It had been identified in human fetal and neonatal lung but not in adult lung. Some symptoms of SCCL may be attributable to bombesin. The syndrome of inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone and Cushing syndrome, occurring with SCCL, are due to ectopic production of antidiuretic hormone and ACTH, respectively. The relation between ectopic hormone production and the aberration involving chromosome 3 is unknown.Baylin et al. (1982)found 12 distinguishing surface proteins on SCCL that were not shared by any of the 3 other carcinogen-induced forms of lung cancer (squamous, adeno-, and large cell undifferentiated carcinoma) or by human lymphoblastoid cells and fibroblasts. The neuroendocrine nature of SCCL was supported by the fact that 6 of the 12 were shared by human neuroblastoma cells. On human SCCL cells and tumors,Ruff and Pert (1984)demonstrated 4 surface antigens previously recognized only in macrophages. They suggested that cancerous cells may arise from macrophage precursors in bone marrow, and these precursors migrate to lung to participate in the repair of tissue damage produced by continuous heavy smoking. About 5% of SCCL patients have no apparent pulmonary involvement and the early, rapid and widespread dissemination of tumor to extrathoracic sites requires explanation.Naylor et al. (1984)used an anonymous, polymorphic DNA probe, D3S3, to confirm the presence of deletion of 3p in SCCL. This probe had been assigned to 3p21-cen. Studying 7 SCCL tumors and normal tissue from the same persons, they found that 6 of the 'normal' DNA samples were heterozygous for the D3S3 MspI polymorphism, whereas in all cases the tumor tissues were homozygous.De Leij et al. (1985)isolated 3 new, well-growing cell lines from SCCL. Deletions in 3p, with 3p23-p21 as the smallest region of overlap, were found.Mooibroek et al. (1987)used a recombinant DNA fragment detecting a RFLP presumably at 3p21 to probe DNA isolated from leukocytes of 12 patients with small cell lung cancer. Four of these patients were heterozygous. Analysis of tumor material from the 4 patients showed homozygosity for either one or the other restriction fragment in every case.Gerber and Scoggin (1987)andNaylor et al. (1987)demonstrated loss of constitutional heterozygosity in SCCL. Comparing tumor and constitutional genotypes of 9 patients with small cell lung cancer,Naylor et al. (1987)found a loss of alleles of chromosome 3p markers in tumor DNA of all 9 patients.Brauch et al. (1987)concluded that loss of alleles on 3p is a consistent change in small cell lung cancer but occasionally occurs in non-small cell lung cancer as well. Using a molecular genetic approach,Kok et al. (1987)found evidence for a consistent deletion at the 3p21 region not only in SCCL but in all major types of lung cancer.Yokota et al. (1987)found loss of heterozygosity for RFLPs on chromosome 3p in 7 of 7 patients, on 13q in 10 of 11 patients, and on 17p in 5 of 5 patients. Deletions at these loci in small cell carcinomas were observed even in tumors without any clinical evidence of metastasis. Furthermore, loss of heterozygosity on 3p and 13q occurred before NMYC amplification and before chromosome 11p deletion. (Loss of heterozygosity on 3p was also detected in the adenocarcinomas from 5 of 6 patients. Heterozygosity of chromosomes 13q and 17p was lost in 10 of 31 patients and in 3 of 12 patients, respectively, of lung cancers other than small cell carcinomas.)Johnson et al. (1988)found unequivocal loss of heterozygosity in the DNA from tumor tissue of 23 of 25 patients who were constitutionally heterozygous for at least 1 marker in the region 3p14-p21.Birrer and Minna (1988)pointed to at least 3 molecular mechanisms involved in the development of lung cancer: deletion of 3p, deregulated expression of the MYC family of genes, and growth factors such as gastrin-releasing hormone (137260).Drabkin et al. (1988)demonstrated that the SCLC 'locus' is proximal to ERBA2 (190160) and also to the constitutive 3p14.2 fragile site. Using 15 chromosome 3 probes that identified 19 different RFLPs,Daly et al. (1991)identified a single 3p deletion extending proximal to the D3S2 locus at 3p21-p14.2 and including at least 3p14-p13. The locus D3F15S2 was excluded from the deleted region, an uncharacteristic feature of SCLC deletions. Moreover, D3S30 and D3S4 were included within this deletion, and thus map within the proximal half of chromosome 3p.Leduc et al. (1989)found that virtually all cases of SCLC had lost heterozygosity at the ERBA2 locus. A smaller but substantial portion of non-small cell carcinomas of the lung had lost heterozygosity at this locus. Among all of the non-small cell tumors, some had lost heterozygosity at a proximal locus but not at ERBA2, whereas none were found where the reverse was true. Thus, the locus that plays a role in non-small cell tumorigenesis probably lies proximal to ERBA2 and is almost certainly not the ERBA2 gene.Sellers et al. (1989)presented epidemiologic data supporting the role of mendelian factors in the susceptibility to human lung cancer. The specific pathology of the tumors studied was not stated in the report.From studies of allele loss by use of 13 RFLP probes on 3p,Hibi et al. (1992)concluded that 3 distinct regions on 3p are frequently deleted in lung cancer: 3p25, 3p21.3, and 3p14-cen.Killary et al. (1992)described a rapid genetic assay system that allowed functional analysis of defined areas of 3p in the suppression of tumorigenicity in vivo. Human/mouse microcell hybrids containing fragments of chromosome 3p were constructed and screened for tumorigenicity in athymic nude mice. Hybrid clones were obtained that showed a dramatic tumor suppression and contained a 2-megabase fragment of human chromosomal material encompassing the region 3p21 near the interface with 3p22. This should be the first step toward isolating the tumor suppressor gene.Chen et al. (1996)analyzed microsatellite repeat markers in plasma, tumor samples, and normal cells from 21 patients with a confirmed diagnosis of small cell lung carcinoma (SCLC). They reported that microsatellite alteration (including loss of heterozygosity or the appearance of new size forms) occurred in 16 out of 21 SCLC tumors and in 15 out of 21 plasma samples. In 52% of cases the marker UT762 on chromosome 21 was altered, and in 38% of cases the marker AR (313700) on the X chromosome was altered.Chen et al. (1996)concluded that analysis of plasma DNA may constitute a new tool for tumor staging, management, or possibly detection. See also275355.Watkins et al. (2003)investigated a role for the Sonic hedgehog (SHH;600725) pathway in regeneration and carcinogenesis of airway epithelium. They demonstrated extensive activation of the hedgehog pathway within the airway epithelium during repair of acute airway injury. This mode of hedgehog signaling is characterized by the elaboration and reception of the SHH signal within the epithelial compartment, and immediately precedes neuroendocrine differentiation. A similar pattern of hedgehog signaling in airway development during normal differentiation of pulmonary neuroendocrine precursor cells, and in a subset of small cell lung cancer, was also observed. Small cell lung cancer tumors maintain their malignant phenotype in vitro and in vivo through ligand-dependent hedgehog pathway activation.Watkins et al. (2003)proposed that some types of small cell lung cancer might recapitulate a critical hedgehog-regulated event in airway epithelial differentiation. This requirement for hedgehog pathway activation identified a common lethal malignancy that may respond to pharmacologic blockade of the hedgehog signaling pathway.By sequencing 29 SCLC exomes, 2 genomes, and 15 transcriptomes,Peifer et al. (2012)found that compared to other tumor types in global sequencing studies, SCLC exhibits an extremely high mutation rate of 7.4 protein-changing mutations per million basepairs. Integrated analyses of various data sets to identify pathogenetically relevant mutated genes found evidence in all cases for inactivation of TP53 (191170) and RB1 (614041) and identified recurrent mutations in the CREBBP (600140), EP300 (602700), and MLL (159555) genes, which encode histone modifiers.Peifer et al. (2012)also observed mutations in PTEN (601728), SLIT2 (603746), and EPHA7 (602190), as well as focal amplification of the FGFR1 (136350) tyrosine kinase gene. Finally,Peifer et al. (2012)detected many of the alterations found in human SCLC tumors in Tp53 and Rb1 double-knockout mice.In a study using exome, transcriptome, and copy-number alteration data from 36 primary human SCLC-normal tissue pairs, 17 matched SCLC and lymphoblastoid cell lines, 4 primary tumors, and 23 SCLC cell lines,Rudin et al. (2012)identified 22 significantly mutated genes in SCLC, including genes encoding kinases, G protein-coupled receptors, and chromatin-modifying proteins.Rudin et al. (2012)found that several members of the SOX family of genes were mutated in SCLC. They also found SOX2 (184429) amplification in approximately 27% of the samples. Suppression of SOX2 using shRNAs blocked proliferation of SOX2-amplified SCLC lines. RNA sequencing identified multiple fusion transcripts and a recurrent RLF (180610)-MYCL1 (164850) fusion. Silencing of MYCL1 in SCLC cell lines that had the RLF-MYCL1 fusion decreased cell proliferation.George et al. (2015)sequenced the genomes of 110 SCLCs and identified biallelic inactivation of TP53 and RB1 (614014), sometimes by complex genomic rearrangements, in nearly all tumors. Two tumors with wildtype RB1 had evidence of chromothripsis leading to overexpression of cyclin D1 (CCND1;168461), revealing an alternative mechanism of RB1 deregulation.George et al. (2015)concluded that loss of the tumor suppressors TP53 and RB1 is obligatory in SCLC. The authors also discovered somatic genomic rearrangements of TP73 (601990) that create an oncogenic version of this gene that lacks exons 2 and 3 (TP53-delta-ex2/3). In rare cases, SCLC tumors exhibited kinase gene mutations, providing a possible therapeutic opportunity for individual patients. Finally,George et al. (2015)observed inactivating mutations in NOTCH family genes in 25% of human SCLCs. Accordingly, activation of Notch signaling in a preclinical SCLC mouse model strikingly reduced the number of tumors and extended the survival of the mutant mice. Furthermore, neuroendocrine gene expression was abrogated by Notch activity in SCLC cells."
182830,"Rothner et al. (1976)described affected mother and 5 of her 6 children. The mother had onset of trouble walking at age 30 and by age 37 had pale optic discs, constricted visual fields, and early dementia in addition to the signs of spastic paraplegia. By the age of 42 she could not manage her home, mainly because of dementia. The onset of disease in the children (3 males, 2 females) was as early as age 7. See311100for a possible X-linked optic atrophy--spastic paraplegia syndrome."
184700,"Stein and Leventhal (1935)demonstrated that obesity, hirsutism, and amenorrhea are clinical correlates of enlarged polycystic ovaries. Thereafter, the criteria were established as bilateral enlarged ovaries, normal 24-hour urinary ketosteroids, and lack of virilization. Response to ovarian wedge resection was included as a criterion by some. The fathers tend to be abnormally hairy, female sibs are hirsute, and mothers and sisters often have oligomenorrhea. Culdoscopy has often shown signs of Stein-Leventhal syndrome, e.g., 8 of 12 sisters of cases showed ovarian changes consistent with that diagnosis (Cooper et al., 1968). Urinary steroid determinations also suggest a genetic basis.Ovarian hyperthecosis was the term used byGivens et al. (1971), who found 41 women (in 2 kindreds) who had hirsutism and/or oligomenorrhea. Ovarian histology performed in 8 showed hyperplasia of theca cells in atretic follicles, a paucity of primordial and developing follicles, and stromal hyperplasia. Elevated levels of androstanedione and/or testosterone and of luteinizing hormone were found. Estradiol and follicle-stimulating hormone levels were low. These levels tended to return to normal after bilateral wedge resection of the ovaries. Some men of the families had low plasma testosterone and had abnormally high LH-FSH ratio as in the women. The pedigrees were consistent with dominant inheritance, probably autosomal because in 1 kindred the disorder was apparently transmitted through a father and son.Mandel et al. (1983)studied 4 families, each with 2 affected sisters; in 1 family, the mother and a maternal aunt were likewise affected. The diagnosis of PCO was confirmed by increased serum testosterone, androstenedione, and LH levels compared to those in normal women. Elevated concentrations of dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate indicated excess adrenal androgen secretion.Kuttenn et al. (1985)concluded that their 24 hirsute women with late-onset adrenal hyperplasia due to 21-hydroxylase deficiency (201910) were indistinguishable from those with idiopathic hirsutism or Stein-Leventhal syndrome.Chrousos et al. (1982)made the same observation. Stein-Leventhal syndrome is probably heterogeneous; see264300for information that some patients may have deficiency of estradiol 17-beta-dehydrogenase. It appears that 'idiopathic hirsutism,' which at times is familial, is sometimes due to increased skin sensitivity to androgen and occurs in the absence of elevated plasma androgens (Kuttenn et al., 1977). On the basis of a large family study,Hague et al. (1986)arrived at an hypothesis of dominant inheritance with meiotic drive accounting for the anomalous segregation. They found PCO in 96% of daughters of affected females and in 82% of daughters of carrier males.Lunde et al. (1989)reported that 19.7% of male first-degree relatives of PCO patients had early baldness or excessive hairiness, as opposed to 6.5% of relatives of controls. For female first-degree relatives, the percentages for PCO-related symptoms were 31.4 and 3.2, respectively. In a subgroup of 52 families of PCO patients in which 1 of the parents was reported to have symptoms, 35% of brothers and 58% of sisters had symptoms. The findings were considered consistent with autosomal dominant inheritance for a 'sizeable fraction of families.' The possibility of X-linked dominant inheritance was eliminated.Franks et al. (1997)favored an oligogenic basis (over autosomal dominant inheritance) for polycystic ovary syndrome. They stated that it is the most common endocrinopathy in women of reproductive age.In preliminary family studies,Legro et al. (1998)found that some female first-degree relatives of women with PCO syndrome have hyperandrogenemia. They hypothesized that this may be a genetic trait suitable for linkage analysis. They examined 115 sisters of 80 probands with PCO syndrome from unrelated families. PCO syndrome was diagnosed by the combination of elevated serum androgen levels and 6 or fewer menses per year with the exclusion of secondary causes. The diagnostic criteria for PCO syndrome were fulfilled in 22% of the sisters. In addition, 24% of the sisters had hyperandrogenemia and regular menstrual cycles. Probands, sisters with PCO syndrome, and hyperandrogenemic sisters had elevated serum luteinizing hormone levels compared with control women. The familial aggregation of hyperandrogenemia in PCO syndrome kindreds suggested that it is a genetic trait which can be used to assign affected status in linkage studies designed to identify PCO syndrome genes.Polycystic ovary syndrome is associated with an increased risk of type II diabetes mellitus. Defects in both insulin action and insulin secretion contribute to this predisposition to diabetes.Colilla et al. (2001)used the frequently sampled intravenous glucose tolerance test to quantitate insulin secretion, insulin action, and their product among 33 women with PCOS and 48 nondiabetic first-degree relatives. They then quantitated the heritability of these measures from familial correlations estimated within a genetic model. The sib correlation for insulin secretion was highly significant. In addition, the parameter quantitating insulin secretion in relation to insulin sensitivity was significant among sibs. The authors concluded that there is a heritable component to beta-cell dysfunction in families of women with PCOS, and that heritability of beta-cell dysfunction is likely to be a significant factor in the predisposition to diabetes in PCOS.Ehrmann et al. (2005)examined the effects of race and family history of type II diabetes on the risk of impaired glucose tolerance (IGT) and type II diabetes in a large cohort of women with PCOS. They found that a family history of type II diabetes in a first-degree relative was associated with an increased risk of metabolic abnormality, IGT, and type II diabetes in women with PCOS. They also observed higher insulin levels and greater insulin resistance in black women with PCOS than in white women with PCOS; these differences remained statistically significant even after taking the family history of diabetes into account.The menstrual disturbances, androgen excess, and obesity that characterize PCOS suggest that women with PCOS may be at increased risk for obstructive sleep apnea.Fogel et al. (2001)observed by overnight polysomnography that women with PCOS had a higher apnea-hypopnea index than controls. The authors concluded that women with PCOS were more likely to suffer from symptomatic obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. Furthermore, apnea-hypopnea index correlated with waist-hip ratio, serum testosterone, and unbound testosterone in women with PCOS.Bonini et al. (2007)performed a complete eye examination on 20 of 62 consecutive patients with PCO with or without hyperandrogenism who had a history of ocular symptoms. Women with PCOS were more likely to have itchy-dry eyes, decreased tear break-up time, and increased conjunctival goblet cell density compared with both PCO patients and healthy subjects.Sir-Petermann et al. (2007)studied adiponectin serum concentrations and metabolic parameters in prepubertal and pubertal daughters of women with PCOS to identify girls with increased metabolic risk. Fifty-three prepubertal and 22 pubertal daughters of PCOS women and 32 prepubertal and 17 pubertal daughters of control women were studied. Both groups had similar chronological ages, body mass index SD score, and Tanner stage distribution. In the prepubertal girls, 2-hour insulin was higher and adiponectin levels were lower in the PCOS daughter group compared with the control daughter group. In the pubertal girls, triglycerides, 2-hour insulin, and serum testosterone concentrations were higher, and SHBG (182205) lower, in PCOS daughters compared with control daughters, but adiponectin (605441) levels were similar in both groups.Sir-Petermann et al. (2007)concluded that some of the metabolic features of PCOS are present in daughters of PCOS women before the onset of hyperandrogenism. Adiponectin appears to be one of the early markers of metabolic derangement in these girls.Polycystic Ovary Syndrome Associated with Male Pattern BaldnessCarey et al. (1993)described an autosomal dominant syndrome of polycystic ovaries and premature male pattern baldness (109200).Carey et al. (1994)demonstrated an association with a change in the 5-prime promoter region of the CYP17 gene (609300), which modified the expression of the syndrome in some families but did not appear to be the primary genetic defect.Govind et al. (1999)screened first-degree relatives of women affected by PCO to obtain evidence for the genetic basis of polycystic ovaries and premature male pattern baldness (PMPB). Of the relatives of 29 PCO probands, 15 of 29 (52%) mothers, 6 of 28 (21%) fathers, 35 of 53 (66%) sisters, and 4 of 18 (22%) brothers were assigned affected status. First-degree female and male relatives of affected individuals had a 61% and 22% chance of being affected, respectively. Of all sibs of PCO probands, 39 of 71 were affected, giving a segregation ratio of 39/32 (55%), which is consistent with autosomal dominant inheritance for PCO/PMPB. Thus the inheritance of PCO and PMPB is consistent with an autosomal dominant mode in PCO families. Sisters of PCO probands with polycystic ovarian morphology were more likely to have menstrual irregularity and had larger ovaries and higher serum androstenedione and dehydroepiandrosterone sulfate levels than sisters without PCO, suggesting a spectrum of clinical phenotypes in PCO families. Men with PMPB had higher serum testosterone than those without. The authors concluded that these data are consistent with a role for genetic differences in androgen synthesis, metabolism, or action in the pathogenesis of PCO."
187360,"Temporal arteritis is the local (and most frequent) manifestation (in temporal artery) of giant cell arteritis (GCA). Polymyalgia rheumatica (PMR), although separately described initially, is known to be the same fundamental process. Involvement of the retinal artery with blindness is a dreaded complication. Elevated erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR) is a regular laboratory feature. Adrenal glucocorticoids are effective therapy. Temporal arteritis was first described by JonathanHutchinson (1890)in 'an old man named Rumbold, the father of a well-remembered beadle at the London Hospital College....He was...quite bald....he had had red 'streaks on his head' which were painful and prevented his wearing his hat. The 'red streaks' proved on examination to be his temporal arteries, which on both sides were found to be inflamed and swollen. The streaks extended from the temporal region almost to the middle of the scalp, and several branches of each artery could be distinctly traced. The condition was nearly symmetrical. During the first week that he was under observation pulsation could be feebly detected in the affected vessels, but it finally subsided, and the vessels were left impervious cords.'Foroozan et al. (2002)compared platelet counts, complete blood counts, and Westergren sedimentation rates (WESR) of biopsy-positive GCA patients with biopsy-negative patients. They found that elevated WESR was more sensitive (79%), while elevated platelet count was more specific (91%) than elevated WESR or the combination of elevated WESR and elevated platelet count. The authors concluded that in patients suspected of having GCA, an elevated platelet count greater than 400,000/mcl is a useful marker of positive temporal artery biopsy.Pache et al. (2002)tested the hypothesis that plasma endothelin-1 (131240) would be increased in 4 patients with biopsy-proven giant cell arteritis. All patients showed significantly increased plasma levels of endothelin-1, although the clinical relevance of the increase required further evaluation.Salvarani et al. (2002)reviewed polymyalgia rheumatica and giant cell arteritis in detail.Hall et al. (2003)examined the role of unilateral temporal artery biopsy in suspected giant cell arteritis. In their series of 181 patients, unilateral temporal artery biopsy was associated with an extremely low frequency (1%) of subsequent positive contralateral biopsy and was not associated with adverse visual or neurologic outcomes for any subject. The authors concluded that in the hands of experienced physicians, a unilateral temporal artery biopsy is sufficient to exclude a diagnosis of GCA in populations for which clinical suspicion is low. Jaw claudication, pale optic disc edema (particularly 'chalky white' disc edema), fever, or any systemic symptom other than headache should raise suspicion of a diagnosis of GCA.Among patients with giant cell arteritis who experienced visual deterioration,Hayreh and Zimmerman (2003)reported that further visual loss occurred in a few patients despite treatment with corticosteroids: 13% of patients treated with intravenous steroids versus 3% of patients who received oral steroids developed further visual deterioration. However, the difference between the 2 groups was not statistically significant."

189800,"Preeclampsia, which along with chronic hypertension and gestational hypertension comprise the hypertensive disorders of pregnancy, is characterized by new hypertension (blood pressure 140/90 or greater) presenting after 20 weeks' gestation with clinically relevant proteinuria. Preeclampsia is 1 of the top 4 causes of maternal mortality and morbidity worldwide (summary byPayne et al., 2011).Preeclampsia is otherwise known as gestational proteinuric hypertension (Davey and MacGillivray, 1988). A high proportion of patients with preeclampsia have glomerular endotheliosis, the unique histopathologic feature of the condition (Fisher et al., 1981). A distinct form of severe preeclampsia is characterized by hemolysis, elevated liver enzymes, and low platelets (HELLP syndrome) (Brown et al., 2000).Genetic Heterogeneity of Preeclampsia/EclampsiaSusceptibility loci for preeclampsia/eclampsia include PEE1 on chromosome 2p13, PEE2 (609402) on chromosome 2p25, and PEE3 (609403) on chromosome 9p13.

192200,"Osler recognized the heritability of varicose veins: 'Varicose veins are the result of an improper selection of grandparents' (Aphorism 335 inBean and Bean, 1950).Arnoldi (1958)suggested that varicose veins are inherited in an autosomal dominant manner with reduced penetrance. He thought that late menarche was related to varicosity. Varicose veins were about twice as frequent in females as in males and no male-to-male transmission was indicated in his illustrative pedigree.Hauge and Gundersen (1969)presented a family study of 249 probands, with the conclusion that multifactorial inheritance seems 'very probable.'Matousek and Prerovsky (1974)used a multifactorial model and estimated heritability to be about 50%.Varicose veins are frequent in some genetic disorders such as the Marfan syndrome.In a study of 2,060 female twin pairs, aged 18 to 80 years, who had responded to a self-administered questionnaire regarding varicose veins and hemorrhoids,Ng et al. (2005)found that casewise concordance rates were significantly higher for monozygotic than dizygotic twins for both phenotypes, corresponding to additive genetic heritabilities in liability of 86% for varicose veins and 56 to 61% for hemorrhoids. Varicose veins and hemorrhoids were significantly correlated. In 900 dizygotic female twin pairs, significant linkage for varicose veins was found at marker D16S520, located about 80 kb from FOXC2 (602402), but no association was found. Both linkage and association tests were negative for hemorrhoids and for the combined phenotype of varicose veins and hemorrhoids.Ng et al. (2005)concluded that varicose veins and hemorrhoids are heritable, related conditions, and suggested that FOXC2 is implicated in the development of varicose veins in the general population."

209850,"Autism, the prototypic pervasive developmental disorder (PDD), is usually apparent by 3 years of age. It is characterized by a triad of limited or absent verbal communication, a lack of reciprocal social interaction or responsiveness, and restricted, stereotypic, and ritualized patterns of interests and behavior (Bailey et al., 1996;Risch et al., 1999). 'Autism spectrum disorder,' sometimes referred to as ASD, is a broader phenotype encompassing the less severe disorders Asperger syndrome (see ASPG1;608638) and pervasive developmental disorder, not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS). 'Broad autism phenotype' includes individuals with some symptoms of autism, but who do not meet the full criteria for autism or other disorders. Mental retardation coexists in approximately two-thirds of individuals with ASD, except for Asperger syndrome, in which mental retardation is conspicuously absent (Jones et al., 2008). Genetic studies in autism often include family members with these less stringent diagnoses (Schellenberg et al., 2006).Levy et al. (2009)provided a general review of autism and autism spectrum disorder, including epidemiology, characteristics of the disorder, diagnosis, neurobiologic hypotheses for the etiology, genetics, and treatment options.Genetic Heterogeneity of AutismAutism is considered to be a complex multifactorial disorder involving many genes.

It is a genetically heterogeneous autoimmune disease affecting about 0.3% of Caucasian populations (Todd, 1990). Genetic studies of T1D have focused on the identification of loci associated with increased susceptibility to this multifactorial phenotype.The classic phenotype of diabetes mellitus is polydipsia, polyphagia, and polyuria which result from hyperglycemia-induced osmotic diuresis and secondary thirst. These derangements result in long-term complications that affect the eyes, kidneys, nerves, and blood vessels."

Brain scans suggested agenesis of the corpus callosum; however, neuropathologic examination showed severe atrophy of the corpus callosum, not the usual agenesis, as well as atrophy of the white matter and absence of pyramidal tracts in the medulla. Other findings were considered to be the expression of a primary disorder of axonal development leading to a reduction in interneuronal synaptic contacts. In the Turkish family, the level of parental consanguinity was extraordinarily high. The father of the 2 affected sisters was the product of a brother-sister mating and the mother of the sisters was the daughter of the son of the 'brother' by a presumably unrelated woman. One sister died at 10 months while suffering from varicella; the second died at 16 months from a pulmonary infection."
225755,"Billard et al. (1989)described apparently monozygotic twins (their patients 13 and 14) who suffered from mild and nonprogressive mental retardation without motor deficit or visual disorders, but with moderate dysmorphia, craniosynostosis, and small stature due to growth hormone deficiency. CT scan showed dense calcifications of the inner aspects of the lenticular nuclei and ventricular dilatation.Bonnemann et al. (1991)described 2 sibs with an encephalopathy, including intracerebral calcification and white matter lesions, dwarfism owing to growth hormone deficiency, and retinal degeneration. The onset of the disease in both sisters occurred with retardation of motor development during the first year of life. Later, dwarfism, mental retardation, spasticity, ataxia, and retinal degeneration became apparent. Differentiation from Cockayne syndrome (see216400) is essential."
226000,"Weinberg and Himelfarb (1943)first introduced the term endocardial fibroelastosis, although the disorder had been described under other designations before. The reports of EFE in sibs include those ofWinter et al. (1960),Zanker and Fisher (1960),Vestermark (1962)andMcKusick (1962).Moller et al. (1966)described EFE in a young woman who died of heart failure during the postpartum period and in the child who was born of that pregnancy and died at 11 months of age. Either genetic causation or viral infection was suggested.Among the children of first-cousin parents,Rafinski et al. (1967)observed 3 who died of EFE at ages 10, 11 and 13 years, which is longer survival than usual. Although the accumulated experience strongly supports the existence of an autosomal recessive variety of EFE, many cases may occur on a nongenetic basis. EFE is called primary or secondary according to whether malformations are not or are associated.Hunter and Keay (1973)described a family in which 2 sisters had 5 affected children, one having affected children by different husbands. Autosomal dominant inheritance with incomplete penetrance was suggested.Rosenquist et al. (1972)attempted, without success, to implicate circulating maternal antiheart antibody as a possible etiology. They studied 2 mothers, each of whom had had 2 affected infants.Westwood et al. (1975)described a family in which there were affected dizygotic female twins, and in another family, an affected half brother and sister with the same father.Jennings et al. (1980)described 2 brothers with EFE, unusual facial appearance, and cryptorchidism. One died at 4 weeks of age. The surviving brother was mentally retarded with seizures.Opitz (1982)discussed the genetics of EFE. EFE is sometimes a manifestation of systemic carnitine deficiency (212140). The occasional families suggesting autosomal recessive inheritance will probably be found to be examples of this or some other form of metabolic cardiomyopathy."
226150,"Fried and Vure (1974)described an Ashkenazi family in which 3 of 4 children died with an almost identical syndrome. Within a week or so of birth, bloody diarrhea with swelling of the abdomen had its onset. All 3 died in a few weeks. Autopsy showed ulcerative colitis in two and pseudomembranous enterocolitis in the third. The parents were second cousins.Megarbane and Sayad (2007)reported a consanguineous Lebanese family in which 3 of 4 sibs had severe early and lethal enterocolitis. The first infant, a girl, passed meconium 24 hours after birth but subsequently developed marked abdominal distention; intestinal biopsy showed diffuse necrosis and no aganglionosis. She died at 1 week of age with abdominal distention and cyanosis. The second infant, also a girl, passed meconium 12 hours after birth but developed abdominal distention, pallor, and hypotonia at 6 days. Alimentation was stopped, antibiotics were started, and she recovered within 2 days. She was readmitted at 22 days with metabolic acidosis, severe shock, cyanosis, and abdominal distention and died due to cardiovascular failure 12 hours later. The third sib was a boy who presented with severe vomiting, abdominal distention, and absence of meconium at 24 hours after birth. He improved when alimentation was stopped and passed meconium at day 5. He developed abdominal distention whenever alimentation was restarted, and was eventually treated with 1 month of parenteral feeding, after which alimentation was gradually reintroduced. Laboratory examination showed a decrease in the proliferation of cytotoxic T cells; brain MRI revealed absence of the corpus callosum. Two months later, he died suddenly, possibly from a urinary tract infection. Postmortem examinations were not permitted by the parents."

234700,"A rather large number of families with multiple affected sibs and normal parents have been reported.Latta and Crittenden (1964)studied the hearts of 2 sibs (the seventh and eighth offspring) who died neonatally of congenital heart block. In neither was an atrioventricular node found, nor were myocardial fibers present in the lower part of the interatrial septum. Both hearts showed foci of calcification, fibrosis, increased vascularization and a few small accumulations of inflammatory cells. Thus, fetal infection (or autoimmune reaction, as discussed later) could have been responsible. In the same family,Crittenden et al. (1964)described 4 of 8 sibs with congenital heart block. A fifth may have been affected. One died at age 14 and the others died in the neonatal period. The parents were normal and of Czechoslovakian ancestry. No mention of consanguinity was made.Cannom and Hancock (1974)described a distinctive syndrome of cardiomyopathy, probably congenital, with mitral regurgitation, complete heart block, and atrial arrhythmia in 4 unrelated male patients. The disorder is relatively benign. No familial occurrence was observed. Congenital cardiomyopathy may be the basis for other instances of congenital complete heart block which might appear in an otherwise normal heart. This appears particularly likely in cases of associated atrial arrhythmia and atrioventricular block.McCue et al. (1977)pointed out an important nongenetic cause of congenital heart block, which, furthermore, can show familial aggregation. Of 22 affected children, 14 were born to 11 mothers with clinical or laboratory evidence of connective tissue disease, mainly systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE;152700). In adults with SLE, changes in connective tissue around the conduction system can lead to heart block. Placental transmission of antinuclear antibodies of the IgG class is documented. Newborns have been reported with transient skin lesions of lupus.Chameides et al. (1977)also observed familial congenital heart block on this basis.James et al. (1975)observed affected brother and sister and made anatomic observations on the latter. This is probably an example of simulation of mendelism by the effects of maternal autoimmunity.Parke and Rothfield (1985)pointed out that complete heart block appears to be due to transplacental passage of maternal IgG antibody to the RNP antigen Ro. They reported the presence of anti-Ro antibody in the serum of a woman with SLE who had 2 infants with congenital heart block. The improved understanding of the pathogenesis of congenital heart block makes understandable the histopathologic findings ofLatta and Crittenden (1964), noted earlier, and also raises doubts about the existence of a mendelian form of congenital heart block.Reichlin et al. (1988)described a family in which an asymptomatic woman gave birth to a son who had complete congenital heart block and who, although clinically well at age 33, developed precipitating antibodies to the Ro/SSA antigen. In the mother, features of both SLE and Sjogren syndrome (270150) developed 26 years after the birth of her son.Deutscher et al. (1988)presented a molecular analysis of human Ro ribonucleoprotein by recombinant methods.Behan et al. (1989)studied 10 patients with congenital heart block due to maternal autoantibodies, together with the mother and sibs in each case. The seropositive mother of 1 affected child had a similar conduction block (bifascicular block) to that in her affected child. None of the sibs had cardiac lesions. Six mothers had Ro or La antibody 5 to 17 years after the birth of the affected child. Four mothers examined 11 to 32 years after the birth of an affected child were seronegative. Three of the mothers had evidence of a connective tissue disorder. It is surprising that heart block develops in some pregnancies of these women.Behan et al. (1989)suggested that the sequence of events is as follows: before or during an early stage of pregnancy, the mother sustains a mild, perhaps unrecognized viral infection, to which she produces Ro or La antibodies. The virus crosses the placenta and damages the infant myocardium while a specific maternal antibody, also crossing the placenta, localizes in the same area. The infection in the child is self-limiting, but it may persist in the mother so that a series of infants are affected. The mother's heart may also be damaged. An obvious viral candidate is a Coxsackie virus, since these viruses are common causes of myocarditis, show sequence homology with some intracellular proteins, and may persist in connective tissue diseases such as dermatomyositis.Manthorpe and Manthorpe (1992)found 4 children with congenital complete heart block among the offspring of 91 Swedish mothers and 71 Danish mothers with primary Sjogren syndrome--a relative risk of about 500, making the incidence of congenital heart block in the general population to be 1 per 20,000.Julkunen et al. (1993)did a retrospective clinical study of 33 mothers at a mean period of 11.2 years after the delivery of their first child with congenital heart block. By the time of the analysis, 2 of the 33 mothers had died and 6 had met the criteria for SLE. As a group, the mothers had clinical and immunologic characteristics more closely related to primary systemic sclerosis than to SLE or any other connective tissue disease. The predominant autoantibody response was to the SS-A/Ro antigens, notably to the 52-kD SS-A/Ro protein (109092), which was present in 97%.Orth et al. (1996)found increased autoantibody titers against human calreticulin (109091) in infants with complete congenital heart block.Cooley et al. (1997)described 2 pairs of monozygotic twins discordant for congenital complete heart block. Both mothers were positive for anti-Ro 52 and anti-Ro 60 antibodies, and neither had anti-La antibody on immunoblot. These cases demonstrated that there can be discordance in the development of congenital complete heart block despite identical genetics and presumably very similar exposure to anti-Ro antibody."

240200,"Addison disease falls into the same category as pernicious anemia, systemic lupus erythematosus, myasthenia gravis, and Hashimoto thyroiditis, in which an autoimmune basis is suggested by some evidence and in which familial aggregation occurs. In all these conditions, the role of a single genetic locus in etiology is unclear. The isolated form of Addison disease is less frequent than that combined with other endocrinopathies, particularly hypoparathyroidism (see240300). A noteworthy feature is the lack of hypoaldosteronism (Stempfel and Engel, 1960;Shepard et al., 1959). Androgen metabolism could not be tested. These cases may well have a defect limited to corticoid metabolism. Some of these cases may with more validity be classed as adrenal unresponsiveness to ACTH (202200).Berlin (1952)reported Addison disease in brother and sister, the latter having also pernicious anemia.Brochner-Mortensen (1956)described Addison disease in 2 brothers and 2 of their maternal uncles.Meakin et al. (1959)described 2 brothers with onset of adrenal insufficiency at age 3 to 4 years.Williams and Freeman (1965)reported adrenal cortical hypofunction without salt loss in 3 of 4 children of second-cousin parents.O'Donohoe and Holland (1968)described autopsy-proven adrenal hypoplasia in a sister of 2 affected males.Lemli and Smith (1968)reported affected sisters. The histologic findings differ in the X-linked (300200) and autosomal recessive forms of adrenal hypoplasia. In the former, the adrenal cortex shows disorganization with poor differentiation of cortical zones and presence of scattered clumps of eosinophilic cells. This is sometimes referred to as the cytomegalic type because of the large cells present as the only remaining cortical tissue. In the latter, there is absence or near-absence of both fetal and permanent cortex. This is sometimes called the 'miniature adult' type because the small adrenal cortex consists almost exclusively of permanent cortex. The latter type occurs either sporadically or as an autosomal recessive condition and may occur alone or, as is often the case, accompanied by anomalies of the brain and pituitary gland, as in anencephaly, or with pituitary gland abnormalities alone.Boyd and MacDonald (1960)reported marked hyperplasia of pituitary basophilic cells. Congenital hypoadrenocorticism may be misdiagnosed as 'sudden infant death syndrome.'In the majority of cases, Addison disease is a component of an autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome, or APS (Gambelunghe et al., 1999). APS1 (240300), a rare disorder, is caused by mutation in the AIRE gene (607358), which resides on chromosome 21. APS2 (269200), more frequently found in adult patients, is a complex multigenic disease. The major histocompatibility complex class I chain-related MICA (600169) and MICB (602436) genes are located on chromosome 6 between the HLA-B (142830) and the B-associated transcript (see142560) genes. The presence of 21-hydroxylase autoantibodies is a sensitive and specific marker of autoimmune Addison disease.Gambelunghe et al. (1999)evaluated the association of APS2-Addison disease with both MICA and MICB gene polymorphism 28 autoimmune (21-hydroxylase autoantibody-positive) Addison disease patients and in 75 healthy subjects from central Italy. They found evidence for a primary association of autoimmune Addison disease with the exon 5 microsatellite polymorphism of the MICA gene (MICA5.1). The MICA5.1 allele was significantly more frequent in Addison disease patients (79%) than in healthy subjects (36%) whereas MICA6 was significantly reduced in affected subjects. The A5.1/A5.1 genotype had an odds ratio for autoimmune Addison disease as high as 18.0 and an absolute risk of 1 per 1,131. In the presence of MICA5.1, MICB/CA-25 was significantly increased in Addison disease patients (15% vs 56%). The MICB/CA-17 allele was absent in Addison disease patients, but present in more than 25% healthy individuals. Among HLA-DR and -DQ haplotypes, only DRB1*03-DQA1*0501-DQB1*0201 (DR3/DQ2) was significantly more frequent in Addison disease patients than in healthy subjects, but only in the presence of MICA5.1. The authors concluded that susceptibility to autoimmune Addison disease is linked to the MICA microsatellite allele 5.1 and that both MICA5.1 and HLA-DR3/DQ2 are necessary to confer increased genetic risk for Addison disease.Skinningsrud et al. (2008)presented evidence suggesting an association between autoimmune Addison disease and a 1858C-T SNP (rs2476601) in the PTPN22 gene (600716.0001) on chromosome 1p13. In a metaanalysis of 3 studies, including their own, comprising 563 European patients with the disorder, the authors found an odds ratio of 1.36 (p = 0.003) for carriers of the T allele."
240400,"As far as is known, all members of the human species lack the ability to synthesize ascorbic acid because man, unlike most other mammals, does not possess the enzyme L-gulonolactone oxidase (EC 1.1.3.8). AsStone (1967)pointed out, hypoascorbemia is an inborn error of metabolism. Borrowing a term from the blood groups, we might say that it is a 'public' inborn error of metabolism. The mechanism whereby an organism loses a particular metabolic function which is of no use in a particular environment was discussed byKing and Jukes (1969). The accumulation of random mutations in the gene for the relevant enzyme might be expected to destroy the functional capacity of the enzyme, most mutations being disruptive. If the enzyme is not required in the particular environment, the constraint of selection is removed. Primates and the guinea pig, by this hypothesis, have lost the capacity to synthesize ascorbic acid because of the adequacy of dietary intake. An intraspecies example of this phenomenon may be the loss of adult intestinal lactase in people who do not consume milk.Nishikimi and Udenfriend (1976)showed that primate and guinea pig liver contains no cross-reacting material for L-gulono-gamma-lactone oxidase.Nishikimi et al. (1988)isolated a cDNA encoding L-gulono-gamma-lactone oxidase of the rat. Northern blot hybridization using the cDNA as a probe demonstrated that guinea pigs lack mRNA for this enzyme. Nevertheless, existence of a DNA sequence related to this enzyme was demonstrated in the genome of both the guinea pig and the human by Southern blot hybridization. The degree of hybridization in the human was less than in the animals possessing the enzyme, suggesting that the human L-gulono-gamma-lactone oxidase gene has diverged more rapidly than the genes of ascorbic acid-synthesizing species. This hypothesis was confirmed by a comparison of a partial nucleotide sequence of the human gene with that of the rat gene. The sequences in the guinea pig and human genomes may represent the remnants of the gene for the enzyme that was once active but became nonfunctional during the course of evolution.Nishikimi et al. (1992)demonstrated that guinea pigs, which, like humans and other primates, cannot synthesize vitamin C, contain a nucleotide sequence of a once active gulonolactone oxidase gene which cross-hybridized to a rat cDNA; this despite the fact that no detectable gulonolactone oxidase-specific mRNA or cross-reactive protein was recognizable by anti-rat GLO rabbit antibody. Comparison of the guinea pig gene with the rat gene demonstrated absence of regions corresponding to exons 1 and 5 as well as other deletions and nonconformance to the GT/AG rule at one of the putative intron/exon boundaries. There were also a large number of mutations in the amino acid-coding regions of the guinea pig sequence, many of which led to nonconservative amino acid changes, and there were 3 stop codons as well. On the basis of the neutral theory of evolution, the date of the loss of the L-gulono-gamma-lactone oxidase in the ancestors of the guinea pig was roughly calculated to be less than 20 million years ago.The disorder of osteogenesis present in the Shionogi rat represents a susceptibility to scurvy because of lack of L-gulono-gamma-lactone oxidase.Kawai et al. (1992)demonstrated that the mutant cDNA has a single base mutation from G to A at nucleotide 182, which changes amino acid 61 from cys to tyr. To test the effect of the cys61-to-tyr mutation, they transfected COS-1 cells with a vector containing the mutant cDNA and showed that the amino acid substitution both decreased the amount of immunologically detectable protein and the level of enzyme activity to about one-tenth of their normal values, while it did not affect the amount of mRNA produced in the transfected cells. Thus, scurvy is a rare inborn error of metabolism in the rat.Nishikimi et al. (1994)isolated a segment of the nonfunctional L-gulono-gamma-lactone oxidase gene from a human genomic library and mapped it to 8p21.1 by spot blot hybridization using flow-sorted human chromosomes and fluorescence in situ hybridization. The isolated segment represented the 3-prime part of the gene, where the regions corresponding to exons 7, 9, 10, and 12 of the rat gene remained with probable deletion of the regions corresponding to exons 8 and 11. A large number of other mutations were found.Levine et al. (1996)performed an in-hospital depletion-repletion study of the relationship between vitamin C dose and steady-state plasma concentration. Seven healthy volunteers were hospitalized for 4 to 6 months and consumed a diet containing less than 5 mg of vitamin C daily. Steady-state plasma and tissue concentrations were determined at 7 daily doses of vitamin C from 30 to 2,500 mg. Vitamin C steady-state plasma concentrations as a function of dose displayed sigmoid kinetics. The steep portion of the curve occurred between the 30- and 100-mg daily dose, the then-current recommended daily allowance (RDA) of 60 mg was on the lower third of the curve, the first dose beyond the sigmoid portion of the curve was 200 mg daily, and complete plasma saturation occurred at 1,000 mg daily. No vitamin C was excreted in the urine of 6 of 7 volunteers until the 100-mg dose was reached. At single doses of 500 mg and higher, bioavailability declined and the absorbed amount was excreted. Oxalate and urate excretion were elevated at 1,000 mg of vitamin C daily compared to lower doses. Based on these data,Levine et al. (1996)recommended that the RDA of vitamin C be increased to 200 mg daily, which can be obtained from fruits and vegetables. Safe doses of vitamin C are less than 1,000 mg daily, and vitamin C daily doses above 400 mg have no evident value.The absorption of vitamin C into the body and its distribution to organs requires the sodium-coupled vitamin C transporters SVCT1 (SLC23A2;603790) and SVCT2 (SLC23A1;603791). SVCT1 is largely confined to epithelial surfaces involved in bulk transport, such as those of the intestine and kidney, whereas SVCT2 appears to account for tissue-specific uptake of vitamin C. SVCT2 expression is widespread, occurring in neurons, the endocrine system, bone, and other tissues (Hediger, 2002).Sotiriou et al. (2002)demonstrated that SLC23A1 is essential for transport of vitamin C into the brain and for perinatal survival. Previously, the only proven requirement for ascorbic acid was in preventing scurvy, presumably because vitamin C is a cofactor for hydroxylases required for posttranslational modifications that stabilize collagen."
241100,"Familial male hypogonadism is a highly heterogeneous category from which some disorders such as Reifenstein syndrome (312300), Kallmann syndrome (see308700), isolated gonadotropin deficiency, and some other entities can be separated.

(2002)quantified vitamin A in the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension, elevated intracranial pressure of other causes, and normal intracranial pressure. Vitamin A could be detected by high-pressure liquid chromatography in most of the specimens. There was a significantly higher level of vitamin A in the cerebrospinal fluid of some patients with idiopathic intracranial hypertension. The authors concluded that vitamin A toxicity might play a role in the pathogenesis of idiopathic intracranial hypertension.Katz et al.

The father presented with cough and exertional dyspnea, whereas the son was asymptomatic. Biopsies confirmed histiocytosis X (eosinophilic granuloma) in both. Neither father nor son had any evidence of disseminated histiocytosis. I have information fromCook (1967)concerning 8 cases of histiocytosis X occurring in 2 sibships in an inbred Mennonite group in Waterloo County, Ontario. In each case the parents were related as second cousins and all 4 parents shared in common a grandparental couple. In 2 cases, treatment with adrenocorticosteroids was begun early and both patients survived. The other cases pursued an identical course. They were well until ages 8 to 18 weeks, following which they developed general irritability, especially on being touched or moved. There was pallor, dyspnea, distended abdomen, fever, and, in the terminal stages, usually jaundice. Medical investigations showed hepatosplenomegaly, anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia. Autopsy showed histiocytic infiltration of the liver, spleen and lymph nodes. There was no persistent skin rash and no bone lesions were identified. The course of the illness in all 6 fatal cases was rapid, ranging from 2 to 5 weeks. None of the children had contact with each other. These cases are also discussed under familial histiocytic reticulosis (267700). The nosology of this category is confused, as is the terminology. For example,Donohue and Thompson (1972)concluded that the Mennonite cases represent the disorder reported as 'familial Letterer-Siwe disease' and not histiocytosis X. The occurrence of 'encephalopathy' in both the Mennonite cases and reported familial Letterer-Siwe disease, but not in either nonfamilial L-S disease or histiocytosis X, was one reason for their conclusion.Kloepfer et al. (1972)observed the same or a similar disorder in an inbred triracial group in Louisiana, known locally as 'Redbones.'The entity described here should not be confused with Langerhans cell histiocytosis (604856) The Langerhans cell, a dendritic cell of the epidermis, was described by a medical student, Paul Langerhans, who thought that it was part of the nervous system (Langerhans, 1868).Birbeck et al. (1961)found that the Langerhans cell displays a unique electron-microscopic morphology. The discoveries that these cells are not confined to skin and that they make up a sizable portion of the cellular infiltrate in histiocytosis X, along with other evidence, suggest that they play an immunologic role in protecting against environmental antigens.Egeler and D'Angio (1995)presented a classification of histiocytosis syndromes in children: class I, Langerhans cell histiocytosis; class II, histiocytosis of mononuclear macrophages other than Langerhans cells, including familial hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis; and class III, malignant histiocytic disorders, including histiocytic lymphoma."
246470,"In an Italian-American family with first-cousin parents,Greenberg et al. (1981)described 2 brothers, in a sibship of 5, who had this combination. In 1, colectomy with ileoproctostomy was performed for multiple adenomatous polyps of the colon at age 35. Because of multiple polyps and adenocarcinoma in situ in the residual rectum, abdominoperineal resection and ileostomy were done at age 40. Leukemia of acute myeloblastic type was discovered at age 45 and the patient died after a 2-month course. The second brother had fulguration of 2 papillary tumors of the bladder at age 25. In the next 3 years, he had multiple colonic polypectomies and abdominoperineal resection for Duke's stage C-1 carcinoma of the rectum. At age 34 he was discovered to have acute myeloblastic leukemia and died after a very short course."

247640,"Patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who present with bulky disease of the lymph nodes, spleen, and mediastinum, so-called lymphomatous ALL (LALL), appear clinically to represent a distinct category of ALL of T-cell lineage. The biologic basis of this distinction was pointed out byChilcote et al. (1985)who found that 6 of 8 patients with clinical features of LALL had karyotypic abnormalities leading to loss of bands 9p22-p21. The mechanisms varied and included deletions, unbalanced translocations, and loss of the entire chromosome. Only 1 of 57 patients without LALL had an abnormality of chromosome 9 at diagnosis. Loss of a 'suppressor' gene (RB1;614041) comparable to that in retinoblastoma (180200) was postulated. A relationship to methylthioadenosine phosphorylase (156540) was postulated because the structural gene for this enzyme maps to the same region and patients with LALL may lack this enzyme in malignant cells during relapse. Lymphoblasts lacking this enzyme are unable to salvage adenine and methionine and are therefore especially sensitive to inhibitors of de novo purine synthesis (Kamatani et al., 1981).Kowalczyk and Sandberg (1981)had earlier found changes in 9p in a subgroup of ALL cases.Chilcote et al. (1985)pointed out that there is a fragile site at 9p21 and raised the question of familial predisposition on this basis. (This fragile site is the breakpoint in the translocation t(9;11)(p21-22;q23), which is associated with acute nonlymphocytic leukemia with monocytic features, ANLL-AMoL-M5a.) The aunt of one of the patients ofChilcote et al. (1985)had died as a child from ALL with lymphomatous features. If the analogy to RB1 holds, there is the same dilemma as to whether this should be called dominant or recessive; by the Chilcote hypothesis, it is presumably recessive. In a large series,Murphy et al. (1985)confirmed an abnormality of 9p in 10 to 11% of cases (33 out of more than 300) of acute lymphoblastic leukemia. The breakpoints in 9p clustered in the p22-p21 region. They could not, however, corroborate the specific association with T-cell origin or so-called lymphomatous clinical features.(Although to our knowledge not the determinant of an inherited phenotype, dominant or recessive, LALL appears to be a specific DNA coding segment that is involved in causation of a specific neoplasm through somatic cell mutation.)"

254200,"Myasthenia gravis (MG) is an autoimmune disease in which antibodies bind to acetylcholine receptors or to functionally related molecules in the postsynaptic membrane at the neuromuscular junction. The antibodies induce weakness of skeletal muscles, which is the sole disease manifestation. The weakness can be generalized or localized, is more proximal than distal, and nearly always includes eye muscles, with diplopia and ptosis. The pattern of involvement is usually symmetric, apart from the eye involvement, which is often markedly asymmetric and involves several eye muscles. The weakness typically increases with exercise and repetitive muscle use (fatigue) and varies over the course of a day and from day to day, often with nearly normal muscle strength in the morning (summary byGilhus, 2016)."
254400,"Mycosis fungoides is a malignant T-cell lymphoma of the skin, first reported (and named) byAlibert (1835).Sezary syndrome is a leukemic variant of mycosis fungoides defined by erythroderma with greater than 80% of the skin showing redness, adenopathy and greater than 1,000 circulating Sezary cells/microliter with a CD4+CD26- or CD4+CD7- phenotype. Sezary cells have a type 2 helper T cell cytokine profile. Sezary syndrome has a median overall survival time of only 2.4 years in patients with Sezary cells at a density of greater than 10,000 cells/microliter or 5.4 years in patients with 1,000-10,000 Sezary cells/microliter. Mycosis fungoides and Sezary syndrome are the most common cutaneous T-cell lymphomas. Sezary syndrome can arise de novo or can appear following years of chronic mycosis fungoides. Both are thought to arise from clonal expansion of CD4+ helper T cells responding to chronic antigen stimulation (summary byWang et al., 2015)."

(1979)observed the same syndrome. IQ was in the vicinity of 70. The nails were hypoplastic with koilonychia and onychorrhexis. Head hair was absent at birth. Later it was short, dry, lusterless, curly, and sparse. The eyelashes were similar and caused chronic irritative conjunctivitis. No axillary hair and only sparse pubic hair developed at puberty. Microscopically, hairs showed trichorrhexis. Neutropenia was persistent with intermittent aggravation. Lymphocytes were increased, especially when the neutrophils were lowest. The patients had recurrent infections.Corona-Rivera et al. (1981)described another case, the offspring of related parents, and called the condition ONMRS to include mental retardation. However,Verhage et al. (1987)described a child typical in all ways except for normal intelligence.

556500,"A number sign (#) is used with this entry because, as reviewed in168600, parkinsonism is a conspicuous and even predominant feature of some of the various neurologic disorders and, as reviewed here, mitochondrial mutations may be involved.The electron transport chain (ETC) of mitochondria is the last step in cellular respiration. The ETC composes the primary mechanism by which electrons are conferred to oxygen for the production of adenosine triphosphate (ATP), a major energy supplying molecule in all cells. The ETC is composed of five transmembrane (spanning the inner mitochondrial membrane) complexes, 4 of which have subunits coded for by mitochondrial and nuclear DNA, 1 of which has subunits coded for by nuclear DNA only. Complexes I, II, III, and IV transport electrons to oxygen and pump protons into the space between the two mitochondrial membranes. Complex V uses the proton gradient to generate ATP. Reactive oxygen species (ROS), molecules that cause damage to existing cellular structures as well as DNA, are created by the activities of the ETC. As a result, abnormal complex activity can lead to an excess of ROS and potential mitochondrial damage.As reviewed byDi Monte (1991), the first suggestion that a mitochondrial defect may be involved in the neuronal death observed in Parkinson disease stems from studies on the mechanism of neurotoxicity of 1-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP). Death of dopaminergic neurons of the substantia nigra after exposure to MPTP is due to the fact that this neurotoxicant is oxidized in the CNS by monoamine oxidase (MAO) type B, generating a metabolite that is the ultimate mediator of MPTP toxicity. Pretreatment of animals with MAO inhibitors protected against the neurotoxic effects of MPTP. In some studies a reduction of complex I activity was found in autopsy specimens of the substantia nigra of patients affected by Parkinson disease.The low concordance of the disease among twins and the reports that prevalence is similar in identical and fraternal twins (Duvoisin, 1986;Marttila et al., 1988) could be explained by mitochondrial inheritance; different mitochondrial phenotypes in monozygotic twins can occur because of random segregation of heteroplasmic mitochondrial DNA from the ovum. To test the mitochondrial hypothesis,Zweig et al. (1992)questioned the occurrence of Parkinson disease in the parents of 252 patients. It was found that 11 fathers and 5 mothers had had this disease. These data failed to provide support for the hypothesis of maternal inheritance. In a review of similar studies in the literature and an additional unpublished study,Zweig et al. (1992)found 922 patients with this disease among whose parents 37 fathers and 19 mothers were reportedly affected.Parker et al. (1989), using platelet mitochondria from 10 patients with idiopathic Parkinson disease (PD), evaluated catalytic activities for complex I (NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase) and complex IV (succinate:cytochrome c oxidoreductase) activity. They found in all ten patients significant reduction of complex I activity and nonsignificant reduction of complex IV activity, suggesting that defects in complex I may explain the pathogenesis of PD.Mizuno et al. (1989), using mitochondria from striata of patients who died of PD, performed immunoblotting studies to assess the amount present of each subunit of complexes I, III, and IV. They found that 3 of 7 subunits of complex I coded for by the mitochondrial genome were present in lower amounts than those of control mitochondria.Shoffner et al. (1991), using skeletal muscle mitochondria from six patients with PD, performed functional assays for all five ETC complexes and looked for mutations in the mitochondrial DNA. The advantage to muscle mitochondria for these studies was the low complex I activity in platelets, the loss of neurons in the substantia nigra of patients with PD, and the more extensive experience with oxidative phosphorylation enzymology in skeletal muscle compared to platelets or neurons. In 4 patients, a decrease in complex I activity was observed. In 1 patient, a decrease in complex IV activity was found. In one patient, no decreases in activity of any complex were found. No known pathological mitochondrial DNA insertion-deletions or point mutations were found.Ikebe et al. (1995)examined mitochondrial DNA from five patients with PD to locate possible mutations. While no recognized point mutations were found, each patient had multiple point mutations that would cause significant changes to products of genes. Each patient had at least one significant point mutation in genes encoding subunits of complex I. The authors suggested that these changes may lead to the increase of or increased susceptibility to damage from oxygen radicals.Swerdlow et al. (1996)used a cybrid cell fusion to repopulate human neuroblastoma cells that had had their mitochondria inactivated with platelet derived mitochondria of patients with idiopathic PD. The cells were assessed for ETC activities, production of ROS, and sensitivity to apoptotic cell death as induced by 1-methyl-4-phenylpyridinium (MPP+), a known inhibitor of complex I. The cybrid technique removes the possibility that ETC assays for activity may not be assessing flaws inherent to ETC complexes rather but toxins or medicines present in the cells of patients with PD. A 20% decrease in complex I activity was seen in the neuroblastoma cell cultures after 5 to 6 weeks of cell division. No significant decrease in complex IV activity was seen. An increase in the production of ROS was seen. Increased susceptibility to MPP+-induced apoptosis was seen. The authors concluded that the complex I defect in PD appeared to arise genetically from mitochondrial DNA, a significant conclusion towards the etiology and pathology of PD.The possibility of mitochondrial dysfunction as the basis of idiopathic Parkinson disease has been particularly attractive sinceVyas et al. (1986)recognized that the parkinsonism-inducing compound N-methyl-4-phenyl-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) is a mitochondrial toxin.Parker and Swerdlow (1998)pointed out that the unique genetic properties of mitochondria also make them worthy of consideration for a pathogenic role in PD. Although affected persons occasionally provide family histories that suggest mendelian inheritance and mutations in the gene encoding alpha-synuclein, SNCA (163890), have been described in autosomal dominant Parkinson disease, most cases are sporadic. Because of unique features such as heteroplasmy, replicative segregation, and threshold effects, mitochondrial inheritance can allow for the apparent sporadic nature of these diseases.To test the hypothesis that mitochondrial variation contributes to expression,van der Walt et al. (2003)genotyped 10 single-nucleotide polymorphisms that define the European mitochondrial DNA haplogroups in 609 white patients with PD and 340 unaffected white control subjects. Overall, individuals classified as haplogroup J (odds ratio = 0.55; 95% CI 0.91; P = 0.02) or K (odds ratio = 0.52; 95% CI 0.30-0.90; P = 0.02) demonstrated a significant decrease in risk of PD versus individuals carrying the most common haplogroup H. Furthermore, a specific SNP that defines these 2 haplogroups, 10398G, is strongly associated with this protective effect (odds ratio = 0.53; 95% CI 0.39-0.73; P = 0.0001). The 10398G SNP causes a nonconservative amino acid change from threonine to alanine within the NADH dehydrogenase 3 (ND3;516002) of complex I. After stratification by sex, this decrease in risk appeared stronger in women than in men. In addition, the 9055A SNP of ATP6 (516060) demonstrated a protective effect for women.Van der Walt et al. (2003)concluded that ND3 may be an important factor in PD susceptibility among white individuals and could help explain the role of complex I in Parkinson disease expression.By haplotype analysis of 455 patients with PD, 185 patients with Alzheimer disease (AD;104300), and 447 controls,Pyle et al. (2005)found that the UKJT haplotype cluster (Torroni et al., 1996) was associated with a 22% reduction in risk for development of PD. There was no association between any haplotypes and AD, indicating that the association was specific for Parkinson disease. Reanalysis of the data reported byvan der Walt et al. (2003)showed similar results for the pooled data of haplotypes U, K, J, and T.Pyle et al. (2005)noted that the 10398A-G polymorphism has been described on several other haplotypes (seeHerrnstadt et al., 2002), indicating that the 10398A-G polymorphism does not 'define' haplotypes J and K, as asserted byvan der Walt et al. (2003).Horvath et al. (2007)reported a 66-year-old German man with parkinsonism due to an 8344A-G mutation in the MTTK gene (590060.0001). Symptoms included bradykinesia, resting tremor, and asymmetric rigidity. He also had proximal muscle weakness, hyporeflexia, decreased distal sensation, and bilateral hearing loss. Serum creatine kinase was elevated. He showed good response to levodopa. Skeletal muscle biopsy showed ragged-red fibers, fiber size variability, centrally placed nuclei, and atrophic and necrotic fibers. There was a mild decrease in some respiratory chain enzymes. The 8344A-G mutation was homoplasmic in muscle and 80% in leukocytes. A brother with progressive hearing loss since age 10 had 70% heteroplasmy in blood.In a patient with early-onset Parkinson disease (PARK6;605909) due to homozygous mutation in the PINK1 gene (608309.0002),Piccoli et al. (2008)identified homoplasmic mutations in the MTND5 (516005.0010) and MTND6 genes (516006.0008), respectively. The patient had onset at age 22 years. His mother, who was heterozygous for the PINK1 mutation, was also homoplasmic for both mitochondrial mutations and showed disease onset at age 53. The father was heterozygous for the PINK1 mutation only and was unaffected at age 79. Biochemical studies of the proband's fibroblasts showed mitochondrial dysfunction, with decreased amounts of cytochrome c oxidase, impaired complex I activity, and increased hydrogen peroxide generation.Piccoli et al. (2008)concluded that the presence of the mitochondrial mutations in combination with the PINK1 mutation may have accelerated the onset of the disease."

600131,"Childhood absence epilepsy (CAE, ECA), a subtype of idiopathic generalized epilepsy (EIG;600669), is characterized by a sudden and brief impairment of consciousness that is accompanied by a generalized, synchronous, bilateral, 2.5- to 4-Hz spike and slow-wave discharge (SWD) on EEG. Seizure onset occurs between 3 and 8 years of age and seizures generally occur multiple times per day. About 70% of patients experience spontaneous remission of seizures, often around adolescence. There are no structural neuropathologic findings in patients with ECA (Crunelli and Leresche, 2002).Genetic Heterogeneity of Susceptibility to Childhood Absence EpilepsyThe ECA1 locus has been mapped to chromosome 8q24; see also EIG1 (see600669), which also maps to 8q24.Susceptibility to the development of childhood absence epilepsy may be conferred by variation in several genes: ECA2 (see607681), conferred by variation in the GABRG2 gene (137164) on chromosome 5q31.1; ECA4 (611136), conferred by variation in the GABRA1 gene (137160) on chromosome 5q34; ECA5 (612269), conferred by variation in the GABRB3 gene (137192) on chromosome 15q12; and ECA6 (see611942), conferred by variation in the CACNA1H gene (607904) on chromosome 16p13.See EIG11 (607628) for discussion of a locus previously designated ECA3 on chromosome 3q26."

600319,"Because of evidence from studies in the nonobese diabetic (NOD) mouse indicating that one diabetogenic gene maps to the mouse Thy1 (188230) locus,Wong et al. (1991)investigated loci in the homologous region of the human, 11q23. In a case-control study, a RFLP analysis of the CD3-epsilon locus (CD3E;186830) in 168 Caucasoid patients with type 1 diabetes showed a significant difference in the frequency of the CD3E 8-kb allele between male and female patients and between female patients and healthy female controls. They interpreted the results as suggesting that a gene on 11q23 may confer susceptibility to type 1 diabetes in women. By the use of an affected sib pair method, however,Hyer et al. (1991)appeared to have excluded the possibility of an IDDM susceptibility gene on 11q.In a screen of the human genome for type 1 diabetes susceptibility genes,Davies et al. (1994)identified 18 chromosome regions, in addition to 6p21 (IDDM1;222100) and 11p15 (IDDM2;125852), that showed linkage to the disease. One of these, designated IDDM4 on 11q13, was confirmed when examined in additional datasets of sib-pair families. IDDM4 was also mapped to 11q13 byHashimoto et al. (1994).With reference to the case-control study ofWong et al. (1991),Pritchard et al. (1995)noted that, although case-control studies are extremely powerful, their value is limited because of population stratification. Therefore, case-control-based claims of association must be confirmed by family-based association studies. Using semiautomated fluorescence-based technology,Pritchard et al. (1995)undertook association and linkage analysis of a nucleotide microsatellite in the CD3-delta gene (CD3D;186790). They also performed a large case-control analysis of a RFLP in the CD3E gene, 26 kb from CD3D. They found no evidence for the previously reported association between the 8-kb allele of the RFLP and disease in a British data set of 403 diabetic patients and 446 nondiabetic controls. Furthermore, the use of the transmission/disequilibrium test (TDT) showed no evidence of linkage or association to type 1 diabetes at either marker locus. They concluded that the CD3 gene region does not contribute significantly to IDDM susceptibility. From the methodologic standpoint, they concluded that fluorescence-based technology can be applied to large-scale, semiautomated association studies with most microsatellite markers.Cordell et al. (1995)applied to insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus an extension of the maximum lod score method ofRisch (1990), which allowed the simultaneous detection and modeling of 2 unlinked disease loci. The method was applied to affected sib pair data, and the joint effects of IDDM1 (HLA) and IDDM2, the INS VNTR, and of IDDM1 and IDDM4 (FGF3-linked) were assessed. In the presence of genetic heterogeneity, there seemed to be a significant advantage in analyzing more than 1 locus simultaneously.Cordell et al. (1995)stated that the effects at IDDM1 and IDDM2 were well described by a multiplicative genetic model, while those at IDDM1 and IDDM4 followed a heterogeneity model.Nakagawa et al. (1998)analyzed 707 affected sib pairs for linkage in the 11q13 region and obtained a peak multipoint maximum lod score (MLS) of 2.7 with linkage (MLS greater than 0.7) extending over a 15-cM region. To refine the location, they first scanned the 15-cM linked region for increased or decreased transmission, from heterozygous parents to affected sibs in 340 families, using the 3 most common alleles of each of 12 microsatellite loci. One of the 36 alleles showed decreased transmission (50% expected, 45.1% observed) at marker D11S1917. Analysis of an additional 1,702 families gave further support for negative transmission (48%) of D11S1917 allele 3 to affected offspring and positive transmission (55%) to unaffected sibs. A second polymorphic marker was isolated from a cosmid clone containing D11S1917, and genotyping of 2,042 families revealed strong linkage disequilibrium between the 2 markers (15 kb apart). These results not only provided sufficient justification for analysis of the gene content of the D11S1917 region for positional candidates, but also showed that, in the mapping of genes for common multifactorial diseases, analysis of both affected and unaffected sibs is of value and that both predisposing and nonpredisposing alleles should be anticipated.Hey et al. (1998)constructed an approximately 200-kb cosmid and BAC contig spanning the D11S1917 region in 11q13. They identified the LRP5 gene (603506), which encodes a novel transmembrane protein, as a positional candidate for IDDM4.Eckenrode et al. (2000)provided additional support for linkage for IDDM4, narrowed the location to an interval of approximately 6 cM between D11S4205 and GALN (137035), and excluded FADD (602457) and GALN as candidate genes. They used affected sib pair and linkage disequilibrium analyses.Paterson and Petronis (2000)used data from a genomewide linkage study of 356 affected sib pairs with type 1 diabetes to perform linkage analyses using parental origin of shared alleles in subgroups based on sex of affected sibs and age of diagnosis. They found that evidence for linkage to IDDM4 occurred predominantly from opposite sex sib pairs."
600351,"In a large Mennonite kindred in Alberta, Canada,Smith et al. (1994)described a seemingly 'new' familial enteropathy manifested by recurrent acute, life-threatening secretory diarrhea associated with distinctive jejunal histologic changes and IgG2 subclass deficiency. Symptoms began abruptly with anorexia and vomiting, and progressed within hours to massive secretory diarrhea and shock with profound neutropenia and hypoproteinemia, including hypoalbuminemia and hypogammaglobulinemia. Affected survivors recovered quickly and thereafter grew and developed normally. Biopsy specimens obtained during remission from 3 adults and 11 children showed club-shaped jejunal villi broadened by edema and histiocytes with imbibed fluid; the overlying intestinal epithelium and brush border appeared normal, but the basement membrane was interrupted in some areas. No characteristic microorganisms had been identified in association with the syndrome. Clinical manifestations ceased in the second decade, but the abnormal jejunal histologic pattern persisted into adult life. Female and male patients were equally affected, although all fatal cases had been in female subjects. Affected individuals had a reduced serum concentration of IgG2. The pedigree published bySmith et al. (1994)showed 31 affected members. Four sibships were affected in the first of the 2 generations and 8 sibships in the second."

They claimed that this represented the strongest reported evidence for linkage to any IDDM locus outside the HLA region. The subset of families in which affected children did not show increased sharing of HLA genes provided most of the support for D14S67 linkage. There was significant linkage heterogeneity between the HLA-defined subsets of families, suggesting toField et al.

Using the MAP-MAKER/Sibs program, which allows multipoint linkage analysis to be performed on data collected from affected sib pairs, a peak maximum lod score was obtained in the region of the markers D2S137-D2S164.Morahan et al. (1996)noted that a predictor of IDDM is the presence of circulating islet antibodies (ICA) in first-degree relatives of affected probands; however, since not all ICA+ individuals progress to clinical disease, genes that control this phenotype (i.e., development of ICA) may act early in the process leading to diabetes mellitus.Morahan et al. (1996)performed additional multipoint linkage analyses including those sibs that had either ICA or IDDM. Results of these analyses showed that evidence for linkage increases at map positions near IDDM13, suggesting that IDDM13 controls an early event in islet cell autoimmunity.Morahan et al. (1996)postulated that identification of this gene may facilitate identification of a subset of at-risk individuals.Fox et al.

601608,"Spastic paraplegia is a progressive degenerative disorder of the central nervous system that results in spasticity affecting primarily the lower limbs without demonstrable cause except an underlying mutation demonstrated or presumed. Heterogeneity is indicated both by mode of inheritance and by clinical distinctions. Evans syndrome is the simultaneous or sequential occurrence of Coombs-positive hemolytic anemia and immune thrombocytopenia without a known underlying etiology (Evans and Duane, 1949). It is a chronic immunologic disorder with a variable clinical course.Ahmed et al. (1996)described 2 Saudi brothers aged 13 and 9 years, the offspring of first-cousin parents, who walked on their toes from an early age and were initially diagnosed as congenital spastic diplegia. Evidence of the Evans syndrome began at age 5 in the older brother and age 2.5 in the younger brother. Rapid deterioration of functional motor ability followed the development of Evans syndrome. It is noteworthy that in the family a sister had died at one year of age with intracranial hemorrhage; she was said to have had hemolytic anemia and thrombocytopenia. Further details of investigations could not be traced. Thus, 3 sibs with Evans syndrome among the offspring of a consanguineous marriage were observed, suggesting autosomal recessive inheritance. Although genetic predisposition in Evans syndrome has perhaps not been specifically noted, familial clustering of cases of autoimmune hemolytic anemia and autoimmune thrombocytopenia as individual entities is well known."
601626,"A number sign (#) is used with this entry because of evidence that acute myeloid leukemia (AML) can be caused by heterozygous mutation in the CEBPA gene (116897) on chromosome 19p13. One such family has been reported.Somatic mutations in several genes have been found in cases of AML, e.g., in the CEBPA, ETV6 (600618), JAK2 (147796), KRAS2 (190070), NRAS (164790), HIPK2 (606868), FLT3 (136351), TET2 (612839), ASXL1 (612990), IDH1 (147700), CBL (165360), DNMT3A (602769), NPM1 (164040), SF3B1 (605590), and KIT (164920) genes. Other causes of AML include fusion genes generated by chromosomal translocations; see, for example,600358and159555.Susceptibility to the development of acute myeloid leukemia may be caused by germline mutations in some genes, including GATA2 (137295), TERC (602322), and TERT (187270).AML may also be part of the phenotypic spectrum of inherited disorders, including platelet disorder with associated myeloid malignancy (FPDMM;601399), caused by mutation in the RUNX1 gene (151385), and telomere-related pulmonary fibrosis and/or bone marrow failure (PFBMFT1,614742and PFBMFT2,614743), caused by mutation in the TERT or the TERC gene."

601666,"Delepine et al. (1997)provisionally denoted a new IDDM susceptibility locus as IDDM15, located near 6q21. Markers in this region are unlinked to HLA (142800) in female meioses but distantly linked (theta = 0.32) in male meioses. This was taken as evidence of a non-major histocompatibility complex-linked susceptibility locus. In addition to the susceptibility loci linked to HLA on 6q21 and to the insulin (176300) locus on 11p12.5 (see IDDM2;125852), 2 IDDM loci had been previously identified on 6q, denoted IDDM5 (600320) and IDDM8 (600883). The study ofDelepine et al. (1997)also provided further evidence for the existence of these 2 loci on 6q.In a genomewide scan for type 1 diabetes susceptibility in Scandinavian families, theEuropean Consortium for IDDM Genome Studies (2001)confirmed the IDDM15 locus on 6q21."

601941,"Because of previous evidence of linkage of the region of 18q12-q21 containing the Kidd blood group (111000) and the DNA marker D18S64 to type 1 diabetes (IDDM; see222100) (Hodge et al., 1981),Merriman et al. (1997)evaluated 12 informative microsatellite markers for linkage with disease by the transmission disequilibrium test (TDT) in a U.K. dataset of type 1 diabetic families (n = 195). They detected increased transmission of allele 4 of marker D18S487 to affected children (P = 0.02). Support for this result was extended to a total of 1,067 families from 4 different countries by isolating, and evaluating by TDT, 2 novel microsatellites within 70 kb of D18S487. Evidence for linkage and association was P = 5 x 10(-5) and 3 x 10(-4), respectively. There was no evidence for increased transmission of associated alleles to unaffected sibs. Analysis of an additional 390 families by TDT did not extend the evidence further, and reduced support in the total 1,457 families to P = 0.001 for linkage and P = 0.003 for association. However, evidence for linkage by affected sib pair allele sharing was strong in the second dataset; P = 3.2 x 10(-5). This IDDM locus was designated IDDM6. Heterogeneity in TDT results between datasets was, in part, accounted for by the presence of more than 1 common disease-associated haplotype (allelic heterogeneity), which confounded the analysis of individual alleles by TDT.Merriman et al. (1997)discussed the enormous challenge of identifying polygenes in a disorder such as IDDM (see222100), because of the combination of locus, allelic, and clinical heterogeneity. On the basis of their results with IDDM6, they made some recommendations for strategies. Evidence of linkage in affected sib pair families (the most common pedigree configuration in common polygenic diseases) should be sought in several different populations. The ideal family datasets are those drawn from isolated populations, such as Sardinia and Finland, or from countries such as Denmark, Sweden, Spain, Italy, or Norway, which are more homogeneous in population than the U.S. or U.K. If only 1 dataset shows positive evidence of linkage to a chromosome region, evidence of replication should be sought by collecting more families from the same country. Given consistent evidence of linkage, linkage disequilibrium should be evaluated specifically in the linked region using all available microsatellites with an appropriate level of polymorphism. The hope is that by defining different founder chromosomes in different populations, regions of strongest and most consistent linkage disequilibrium with multiple markers can be defined.Using a single microsatellite marker at each locus,Vaidya et al. (2000)screened the type 1 diabetes loci IDDM4, IDDM5, IDDM6, IDDM8 (600883), and IDDM10 (601942), as well as the fucosyltransferase-2 locus (FUT2;182100), for linkage in sib pairs with Graves disease (275000). A 2-point nonparametric linkage (NPL) score of 1.57 (P = 0.06) at the IDDM6 marker D18S41 was found, but NPL scores were less than 1.0 at the other 5 loci. The investigation of the IDDM6 locus was extended by genotyping 11 microsatellite markers spanning 48 cM across 18q12-q22 in 81 sib pairs affected with autoimmune thyroid disease (AITD; see608173). Multipoint analysis showed a peak NPL score of 3.46 (P = 0.0003) at marker D18S487. This locus is also designated AITD5."

602068,"Tegumentary leishmaniasis due to the parasite Leishmania braziliensis occurs in 2 stages after the infected sandfly bite: (1) a primary cutaneous lesion followed by (2) a secondary mucosal involvement generally resulting in severe facial deformities. To assess genetic and environmental factors involved in the development of the cutaneous lesion,Alcais et al. (1997)performed a family study in a region of Bolivia where the disease is endemic. This study involved 118 nuclear families, each with at least 1 cutaneous affected subject; 41 families were of native origin, and 77 (designated 'migrant') had recently settled in the area. The investigators concluded that in the 77 migrant families a recessive major gene controlled the onset of the primary cutaneous lesion, with residual familial dependencies and age-genotype interaction. Penetrance estimation showed that young subjects were genetically more susceptible than older subjects, suggesting that this genetic component could concern mechanisms involved in the development of individual protection during childhood. There was a significant genetic heterogeneity according to the native or migrant origin of the families, and no major-gene effect was found in the native subsample.Leishmania parasites in Latin America cause cutaneous (CL) and mucocutaneous leishmaniasis (MCL). MCL is associated with persistent inflammatory immune responses. Parasites from MCL patients reproduce the metastatic phenotype in a hamster model. Using DNA microarray analysis and metastatic and nonmetastatic Leishmania guyanensis clones in infected and uninfected mouse bone marrow-derived macrophages,Ives et al. (2011)observed increased expression of Ccl5 (187011), Cxcl10 (147310), Ifnb (147640), Tnf (191160), and Il6 (147620) after infection with metastatic parasites compared with nonmetastatic parasites or parasites obtained from CL patients. Induction of these proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines occurred in a Tlr3 (603029)- and Trif (TICAM1;607601)-dependent manner. Metastatic L. guyanensis expressed higher levels of a Leishmania double-stranded RNA virus, LRV1, and this virus alone induced high chemokine and cytokine expression. Mice lacking Tlr3 had decreased parasite burden and footpad swelling after infection compared with wildtype mice.Ives et al. (2011)concluded that recognition of LRV1 within metastatic Leishmania parasites promotes inflammation and subverts the immune response to Leishmania, leading to parasite persistence."

Onset typically occurs during the first 2 years of life (review bySoderhall et al., 2007).Genetic Heterogeneity of Atopic DermatitisMany inflammatory diseases, such as atopic eczema, are genetically complex, with multiple alleles at several loci thought to be involved in their pathogenesis. Several susceptibility loci for atopic dermatitis have been identified: ATOD1 on chromosome 3q21, ATOD2 (605803) on chromosome 1q21, ATOD3 (605804) on chromosome 20p, ATOD4 (605805) on chromosome 17q25.3, ATOD5 (603165) on chromosome 13q12-q14, ATOD6 (605845) on chromosome 5q31-q33, ATOD7 (613064) on chromosome 11q13.5, ATOD8 (613518) on chromosome 4q22.1, and ATOD9 (613519) on chromosome 3p24."
603266,"On the basis of a genomic search for linkage,Verge et al. (1998)concluded that a locus contributing to type I diabetes in a large Bedouin Arab family was located on 10q25. The family contained 19 affected relatives all of whom carried 1 or 2 high-risk HLA-DR3 haplotypes that were rarely found in other family members. One chromosome 10 haplotype, the B haplotype, was transmitted from a heterozygous parent to 13 of 13 offspring compared to 10 of 23 unaffected sibs. Recombination events occurring on this haplotype placed the susceptibility locus in an 8-cM interval between D10S1750 and D10S1773. Two adjacent markers, D10S592 and D10S554, showed evidence of linkage disequilibrium with the disease locus. These 2 markers and the closest flanking markers were contained in a 1,240-kb YAC, a region small enough to make positional cloning feasible. Six of 14 or more IDDM loci previously reported in studies of Caucasian affected sib pairs (Luo et al., 1996) met the suggested criteria for confirmed linkage (Lander and Kruglyak, 1995), but none of these loci corresponded to the locus at 10q25. These 6 loci were IDDM1 (222100), linked to HLA, IDDM2 (125852), linked to the INS gene (176730), IDDM4 (600319) at 11q13, IDDM5 (600320) at 6q25, IDDM8 (600883) at 6q27, and IDDM12 (601388) at 2q33 where linkage disequilibrium with the CTLA4 locus (123890) has been found.Verge et al.

The brain pathology of 5 deceased members of this family, from 2 generations, represented a coexisting beta-amyloid and prion protein (PrP;176640) pathology. Frequent beta-amyloid-positive senile plaques were observed, together with senile plaques stained by the monoclonal antibody against PrP(106-126). In all 5 cases, the cerebral cortex showed spongiform changes, mainly in the superficial layers, with some degree of gliosis. Successive sections showed that both beta-amyloid- and PrP-positive senile plaques were deposited in all layers of the frontal and temporal cortex. More than 50% of senile plaques were immunopositive for both beta-amyloid and PrP(106-126) antibodies. The proportion of senile plaques marked for each antibody alone was smaller, and, in particular, senile plaques marked for PrP(106-126) represented only 5 to 10% of the whole population."

(2000)presented the result of a genome scan of 126 pedigrees with 2 or more cases of SLE, including 469 sib pairs (affected and unaffected) and 175 affected relative pairs. Using the revised multipoint Haseman-Elston regression technique for concordant and discordant sib pairs and a conditional logistic regression technique for affected relative pairs, they identified linkage to chromosome 4p16-p15.2 (p = 0.0003, lod = 3.84) and presented evidence of an epistatic interaction between 4p16-p15.2 and chromosome 5p15 in European American families. Using data from an independent pedigree collection, they confirmed the linkage to 4p16-p15.2 in European American families. The most significant linkage that they found in the African American subset was to the previously identified region on 1q (SLEB1;601744).Nath et al. (2002)found that lod scores were higher when linkage analysis was confined to families in which at least 1 SLE patient was diagnosed with the presence of neuropsychiatric manifestations such as seizures and psychosis. The authors stated that the segregation behavior of this linked locus suggested a dominant mode of inheritance with an almost 100% homogeneous genetic effect in these pedigrees.Xing et al. (2007)reanalyzed the 77 European American families consisting of 301 full sib pairs previously studied byGray-McGuire et al. (2000)and confirmed significant linkage at 4p (p = 0.000087). The linkage signal at 4p16 was replicated in another cohort of 76 European American families consisting of 221 full sib pairs (p = 0.0047). Two-point and multipoint model-based linkage analyses in all 153 families yielded maximum lod scores of 3.51 and 4.84 at D4S3007, respectively, under a recessive model with penetrance of 0.8. Haplotype analysis using densely spaced microsatellite markers in the linkage region localized the potential SLE susceptibility locus telomeric to D4S2928. A genomewide linkage scan revealed significant interaction between 4p16 and 2p11 (p = 0.003) and 19q13 (p = 0.0094), with marginal interaction at 12q24 (p = 0.066)."

In addition to relative macrocephaly, magnetic resonance imaging showed severe cerebral atrophy, especially in the frontotemporal regions. The brothers also had a thin corpus callosum and atrophic caudate nuclei. The reduced white matter showed patchy periventricular signal intensity changes. The lateral and third ventricles were large, and the fourth ventricle was of normal size. The boys had large cisterna magna, communicating widely with the fourth ventricle, but no vermian hypoplasia. Both boys had Lennox-Gastaut spectrum type epilepsy. No chromosomal anomalies were found. Some of the clinical findings resembled fetal alcohol effects/fetal alcohol syndrome, which was also suggested by history. The severe epilepsy in the brothers was of multiple seizure type (especially myoclonic), necessitating polytherapy.Nokelainen et al. (2001)suggested that these brothers had an unidentified inherited syndrome, possibly modified by fetal alcohol exposure, which they referred to as an inherited encephalopathy. The extent of the exposure to alcohol was not detailed; however, it was thought that many of the features were not explained by fetal alcohol syndrome, including macrocephaly. The disease had progressed slowly during the first decade of life. The patients were Finnish, but none of the features satisfied those of any of the identified 'Finnish diseases.'"

Mental retardation coexists in approximately two-thirds of individuals with ASD, except for Asperger syndrome, in which mental retardation is conspicuously absent (Jones et al., 2008). Genetic studies in autism often include family members with these less stringent diagnoses (Schellenberg et al., 2006).For a discussion of genetic heterogeneity of autism, see209850."
607411,"Persistent patency of the ductus arteriosus, or patent ductus arteriosus (PDA), is the second most common congenital heart disease, affecting approximately 1 in 1,600 to 5,000 live births in the U.S. (Mitchell et al., 1971). In fetal life, the ductus arteriosus, a muscular artery, shunts blood from the pulmonary artery to the aorta, bypassing the lungs. Its abrupt closure at birth establishes the mature circulatory pattern and represents a dramatic example of vascular remodeling. Failure of this normal process results in persistent PDA, which left untreated can result in pulmonary hypertension and heart failure. Closure of the ductus is a complex process. Aspects of this process are regulated by oxygen tension and a decrease in levels of hormones such as prostaglandin E2. PDA occurring in preterm infants often closes spontaneously or in response to inhibitors of prostaglandin biosynthesis (Ramsay et al., 1987). Term PDA typically has not been regarded as a genetic disorder, because it most often occurs sporadically. Nonetheless, term PDA recurs among 5% of sibs of PDA cases (Polani and Campbell, 1960;Lamy et al., 1957), suggesting a genetic component to disease pathogenesis that has typically been presumed to be multifactorial. That single genes can influence this trait has been demonstrated by a mouse model of PDA resulting from disruption of the prostaglandin E2 receptor (Nguyen et al., 1997) and by rare syndromic forms of PDA such as Char syndrome (169100), an autosomal dominant disorder caused by mutations in the transcription factor TFAP2B (601601) (Mani et al., 2002).Genetic Heterogeneity of Patent Ductus ArteriosusAutosomal dominant forms of patent ductus arteriosus include PDA2 (617035), caused by mutation in the TFAP2B gene (601601) on chromosome 6p12, and PDA3 (617039), caused by mutation in the PRDM6 gene (616982) on chromosome 5q23.Hajj and Dagle (2012)reviewed the genetics of patent ductus arteriosus in both term and preterm infants, and discussed possible environmental risk factors as well as animal models of PDA."

607501,"For a phenotypic description and discussion of genetic heterogeneity of migraine headaches, see MGR1 (157300).Migraine is a complex and heterogeneous disorder characterized by recurrent attacks of headache associated with autonomic and neurologic symptoms. Two primary types of migraine can be distinguished: migraine without aura (MO) and migraine with aura.Soragna et al. (2003)studied a large 4-generation Italian family, originating from a restricted geographic area of northern Italy, in which migraine without aura appeared to segregate as an autosomal dominant trait. They excluded association between MO in this family and previously identified migraine loci, including the migraine with aura susceptibility locus on chromosome 4q24 (157300). Using a genomewide scan, they obtained significant evidence of linkage between the MO phenotype and marker D14S978 on 14q22.1 (maximum 2-point lod score of 3.70 at a recombination fraction of 0.01). Multipoint parametric analysis (maximum lod score of 5.25 between markers D14S976 and D14S978) and haplotype construction showed strong evidence of linkage in a 10-cM region flanked by markers D14S1027 and D14S980 on 14q21.2-q22.3."
