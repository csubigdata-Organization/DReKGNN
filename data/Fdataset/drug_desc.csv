DB00007,"Leuprolide is a synthetic 9-residue peptide analogue of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). Unlike the endogenous decapeptide GnRH, leuprolide contains a single D-amino acid (D-leucyl) residue, which helps to increase its circulating half-life from three to four minutes to approximately three hours.[A203222] As a GnRH mimic, leuprolide is capable of binding to the GnRH receptor (GnRHR) and inducing downstream modulation of both gonadotropin hormone and sex steroid levels. Prolonged activation of GnRHR results in significant downregulation of sex steroid levels, which is primarily responsible for the clinical efficacy of leuprolide in diverse conditions, including advanced prostate cancer, endometriosis, and central precocious puberty.[A203126, A203132]

Leuprolide was first approved in 1985 as a daily subcutaneous injection under the tradename Lupron™ by Abbvie Endocrine Inc.[L13850] Since this initial approval, various long-acting intramuscular and subcutaneous products have been developed such that patients can be dosed once every six months.[L13781, L13790] Leuprolide remains frontline therapy in all conditions for which it is indicated for use."
DB00010,Sermorelin acetate is the acetate salt of an amidated synthetic 29-amino acid peptide (GRF 1-29 NH 2 ) that corresponds to the amino-terminal segment of the naturally occurring human growth hormone-releasing hormone (GHRH or GRF) consisting of 44 amino acid residues
DB00014,"Goserelin is a synthetic hormone. In men, it stops the production of the hormone testosterone, which may stimulate the growth of cancer cells. In women, goserelin decreases the production of the hormone estradiol (which may stimulate the growth of cancer cells) to levels similar to a postmenopausal state. When the medication is stopped, hormone levels return to normal."
DB00017,"Synthetic peptide, 32 residues long formulated as a nasal spray."
DB00035,"Desmopressin (dDAVP), a synthetic analogue of 8-arginine vasopressin (ADH), is an antidiuretic peptide drug modified by deamination of 1-cysteine and substitution of 8-L-arginine by 8-D-arginine. ADH is an endogenous pituitary hormone that has a crucial role in the control of the water content in the body. Upon release from the stimulation of increased plasma osmolarity or decreased circulating blood volume, ADH mainly acts on the cells of the distal part of the nephron and the collecting tubules in the kidney [T28]. The hormone interacts with V1, V2 or V3 receptors with differing signal cascade systems.

Desmopressin displays enhanced antidiuretic potency, fewer pressor effects due to V2-selective actions, and a prolonged half-life and duration of action compared to endogenous ADH [A31661]. It has been employed clinically since 1972 and is available in various formulations including intranasal solution, intravenous solution, oral tablet and oral lyophilisate [A31662]. Desmopressin is indicated for the treatment of polyuric conditions including primary nocturnal enuresis, nocturia, and diabetes insipidus. It was also newly approved for the treatment of mild classical hemophilia and von Willebrand's disease for minor surgeries. The active ingredient in most formulations is desmopressin acetate. Nocdurna, or desmopressin acetate, was approved by the FDA on June 21st, 2018 for the treatment of nocturia due to nocturnal polyuria in adults. It is available as a sublingual tablet."
DB00067,"Vasopressin (arginine-vasopressin or antidiuretic hormone) is a nonapeptide primarily produced in the hypothalamus that exhibits diverse physiological functions related to diuresis, hemodynamic modulation, and behaviour.[A110, A111, A112, A113, A228008] Vasopressin is very similar to oxytocin, differing in the third and eighth amino acids.[A228013] Despite a wide variety of functions, exogenous vasopressin is primarily used to control blood pressure during systemic shock by increasing vasoconstriction and renal fluid reuptake by acting through V<sub>1</sub> and V<sub>2</sub> cellular receptors.[A228008, A228013, A228018, L31413]

The vasopressive effect of posterior pituitary gland extracts was noted in 1895, while vasopressin itself was not purified until 1951. It has been used for more than five decades for varying conditions, including variceal bleeding, diabetes insipidus, and, more recently, vasodilatory shock.[A228013] It is currently marketed under the trademark VASOSTRICT® by PAR Pharmaceuticals.[L31413]"
DB00091,"Cyclosporine is a calcineurin inhibitor known for its immunomodulatory properties that prevent organ transplant rejection and treat various inflammatory and autoimmune conditions. It is isolated from the fungus _Beauveria nivea_.[A174049] Initially manufactured by Sandoz and approved for use by the FDA in 1983, cyclosporine is now available in various products by Novartis (previously known as Sandoz).[L11097,L3734,L11118]"
DB00104,"Acromegaly is a disorder caused by excess growth hormone (GH), increasing the growth of body tissues and causing metabolic dysfunction.[L14501] In most cases, it results from an anterior pituitary growth hormone-releasing tumor. Typically, the feet, hands, and face grow abnormally large; organomegaly and insulin resistance may also occur. Acromegaly is a life-threatening disease requiring life-long management.[L14501]

Octreotide is a long-acting drug with pharmacologic activities that mimic those of the natural hormone, somatostatin, which inhibits the secretion of growth hormone.[L14513] Additionally, it is used for the treatment of acromegaly and symptoms arising from various tumors, including carcinoid tumors and vasoactive intestinal tumors (VIPomas).[L14513] In the past, octreotide has been administered solely by injection. On June 26, 2020, the first approved delayed-release oral somatostatin analog, Mycapssa, received FDA approval for the long term maintenance treatment of acromegaly. This drug was developed by Chiasma Inc.[L14495,L14507,L14528]"
DB00114,"This is the active form of vitamin B6 serving as a coenzyme for synthesis of amino acids, neurotransmitters (serotonin, norepinephrine), sphingolipids, aminolevulinic acid. During transamination of amino acids, pyridoxal phosphate is transiently converted into pyridoxamine phosphate (pyridoxamine)."
DB00115,"Cyanocobalamin (commonly known as Vitamin B12) is a highly complex, essential vitamin, owing its name to the fact that it contains the mineral, cobalt. This vitamin is produced naturally by bacteria [A175276], and is necessary for DNA synthesis and cellular energy production. Vitamin B12 has many forms, including the cyano-, methyl-, deoxyadenosyl- and hydroxy-cobalamin forms. The _cyano_ form, is the most widely used form in supplements and prescription drugs [A175255], [FDA label].  Several pharmaceutical forms of cyanocobalamin have been developed, including the tablet, injection, and nasal spray forms [FDA label], [L5542], [L5545].  This drug was initially approved by the FDA in 1942 [FDA label]."

DB00126,"A six carbon compound related to glucose. It is found naturally in citrus fruits and many vegetables. Ascorbic acid is an essential nutrient in human diets, and necessary to maintain connective tissue and bone. Its biologically active form, vitamin C, functions as a reducing agent and coenzyme in several metabolic pathways. Vitamin C is considered an antioxidant."
DB00131,"Adenosine phosphate, or adenylic acid, is an adenine nucleotide containing one phosphate group esterified to the sugar moiety in the 2&#39;-, 3&#39;-, or 5&#39;-position. Adenosine phosphate was withdrawn by the FDA since it was considered neither safe nor effective for its intended uses as a vasodilator and an anti-inflammatory.[L43937]"
DB00136,"Calcitriol is an active metabolite of vitamin D with 3 hydroxyl (OH) groups and is commonly referred to as 1,25-dihydroxycholecalciferol, or 1alpha,25-dihydroxyvitamin D<sub>3</sub>, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D<sub>3</sub>. It is produced in the body after series of conversion steps of 7-dehydrocholesterol from exposure to UV light. 7-dehydrocholesterol is converted to [DB00169] (vitamin D3) in the skin, which is then converted to [DB00146] in the liver and kidneys. [DB00146] undergoes hydroxylation to form calcitriol via 1α-hydroxylase (CYP27B1) activity [A26353]. Calcitriol is considered to be the most potent metabolite of vitamin D in humans [A3366]. Renal production of calcitriol is stimulated in response to PTH, low calcium and low phosphate [A26353]. Calcitriol plays a role in plasma calcium regulation in concert with parathyroid hormone (PTH) by enhancing absorption of dietary calcium and phosphate from the gastrointestinal tract, promoting renal tubular reabsorption of calcium in the kidneys, and stimulating the release of calcium stores from the skeletal system. In addition to promoting fatty acid synthesis and inhibiting lipolysis, calcitriol has been demonstrated to increase energy efficiency by suppressing UCP2 expression, which is modulated by signaling pathways of classical nuclear receptors (nVDR), where calcitriol acts as a natural ligand [A175615]. There is also evidence that calcitriol modulates the action of cytokines and may regulate immune and inflammatory response, cell turnover, cell differentiation [A26353]. 

Administered orally and intravenously, calcitriol is commonly used as a medication in the treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism and resultant metabolic bone disease, hypocalcemia in patients undergoing chronic renal dialysis, and osteoporosis. It is also available in topical form for the treatment of mild to moderate plaque psoriasis in adults. Calcitriol is marketed under various trade names including Rocaltrol (Roche), Calcijex (Abbott) and Decostriol (Mibe, Jesalis)."
DB00140,"Nutritional factor found in milk, eggs, malted barley, liver, kidney, heart, and leafy vegetables. The richest natural source is yeast. It occurs in the free form only in the retina of the eye, in whey, and in urine; its principal forms in tissues and cells are as flavin mononucleotide and flavin-adenine dinucleotide."
DB00153,"Ergocalciferol is an inactivated vitamin D analog.[A177526] It is synthesized by some plants in the presence of UVB light.[T577] The production of ergocalciferol was prompted by the identification of dietary deficiency, more specifically vitamin D, as the main causative factor for the development of rickets. Ergocalciferol was isolated for the first time from yeast in 1931 and its structure was elucidated in 1932.[T580]

Ergocalciferol is considered the first vitamin D analog and is differentiated from [cholecalciferol] by the presence of a double bond between C22 and C23 and the presence of a methyl group at C24. These modifications reduce the affinity of ergocalciferol for the vitamin D binding protein resulting in faster clearance, limits its activation, and alters its catabolism.[A177637]

The first approved product containing ergocalciferol under the FDA records was developed by US Pharm Holdings and was FDA approved in 1941.[L6058]"
DB00160,"Alanine is a non-essential amino acid that occurs in high levels in its free state in plasma. It is produced from pyruvate by transamination. It is involved in sugar and acid metabolism, increases immunity, and provides energy for muscle tissue, brain, and the central nervous system."
DB00162,"Retinol and derivatives of retinol that play an essential role in metabolic functioning of the retina, the growth of and differentiation of epithelial tissue, the growth of bone, reproduction, and the immune response. Dietary vitamin A is derived from a variety of carotenoids found in plants. It is enriched in the liver, egg yolks, and the fat component of dairy products."
DB00163,"In 1922, vitamin E was demonstrated to be an essential nutrient[A32448]. Vitamin E is a term used to describe 8 different fat soluble tocopherols and tocotrienols, alpha-tocopherol being the most biologically active[A176104]. Vitamin E acts as an antioxidant, protecting cell membranes from oxidative damage[A176104]. The antioxidant effects are currently being researched for use in the treatment of diseases causing bone loss, cardiovascular diseases, diabetes mellitus and associated comorbidities, eye diseases, inflammatory diseases (including skin conditions), lipid disorders, neurological diseases, and radiation damage[A176369]. Though this research is so far inconclusive, vitamin E remains a popular supplement and is generally considered safe by the FDA[FDA Label]."
DB00165,"Pyridoxine is the 4-methanol form of vitamin B6, an important water-soluble vitamin that is naturally present in many foods. As its classification as a vitamin implies, Vitamin B6 (and pyridoxine) are essential nutrients required for normal functioning of many biological systems within the body. While many plants and microorganisms are able to synthesize pyridoxine through endogenous biological processes, animals must obtain it through their diet. 

More specifically, pyridoxine is converted to pyridoxal 5-phosphate in the body, which is an important coenzyme for synthesis of amino acids, neurotransmitters (serotonin, norepinephrine), sphingolipids, and aminolevulinic acid. It's important to note that Vitamin B6 is the collective term for a group of three related compounds, pyridoxine, pyridoxal, and pyridoxamine, and their phosphorylated derivatives, pyridoxine 5'-phosphate, pyridoxal 5'-phosphate and pyridoxamine 5'-phosphate. Although all six of these compounds should technically be referred to as vitamin B6, the term vitamin B6 is commonly used interchangeably with just one of them, pyridoxine [A32836]. 

Vitamin B6, principally in its biologically active coenzyme form pyridoxal 5'-phosphate, is involved in a wide range of biochemical reactions, including the metabolism of amino acids and glycogen, the synthesis of nucleic acids, hemogloblin, sphingomyelin and other sphingolipids, and the synthesis of the neurotransmitters serotonin, dopamine, norepinephrine and gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) [A32837]. 

Pyridoxine is used medically for the treatment of vitamin B6 deficiency and for the prophylaxis of isoniazid-induced peripheral neuropathy (due to [DB00951]'s mechanism of action which competitively inhibits the action of pyridoxine in the above-mentioned metabolic functions). It is also used in combination with [DB00366] (as the commercially available product Diclectin) for the treatment of nausea and vomiting in pregnancy."
DB00167,An essential branched-chain aliphatic amino acid found in many proteins. It is an isomer of leucine. It is important in hemoglobin synthesis and regulation of blood sugar and energy levels.
DB00169,"Vitamin D, in general, is a secosteroid generated in the skin when 7-dehydrocholesterol located there interacts with ultraviolet irradiation - like that commonly found in sunlight [L5689]. Both the endogenous form of vitamin D (that results from 7-dehydrocholesterol transformation), vitamin D3 (cholecalciferol), and the plant-derived form, vitamin D2 (ergocalciferol), are considered the main forms of vitamin d and are found in various types of food for daily intake [L5689]. Structurally, ergocalciferol differs from cholecalciferol in that it possesses a double bond between C22 and C23 and has an additional methyl group at C24 [L5689]. Finally, ergocalciferol is pharmacologically less potent than cholecalciferol, which makes vitamin D3 the preferred agent for medical use [L5689].

Appropriate levels of vitamin D must be upheld in the body in order to maintain calcium and phosphorus levels in a healthy physiologic range to sustain a variety of metabolic functions, transcription regulation, and bone metabolism [A223, L5689, L1782, L5771, F4027, F4042, F4048]. However, studies are also ongoing to determine whether or not cholecalciferol may also play certain roles in cancer, autoimmune disorders, cardiovascular disease, and other medical conditions that may be associated with vitamin D deficiency [L5689]."
DB00175,"Pravastatin is the 6-alpha-hydroxy acid form of [mevastatin].[T303] Pravastatin was firstly approved in 1991 becoming the second available statin in the United States. It was the first statin administered as the active form and not as a prodrug.[T274] This drug was developed by Sankyo Co. Ltd.; however, the first approved pravastatin product was developed by Bristol Myers Squibb and FDA approved in 1991.[L6142]

Pravastatin is made through a fermentation process in which [mevastatin] is first obtained. The manufacturing process is followed by the hydrolysis of the lactone group and the biological hydroxylation with _Streptomyces carbophilus_ to introduce the allylic 6-alcohol group.[T239]"
DB00176,"Fluvoxamine is an antidepressant which functions pharmacologically as a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor. Though it is in the same class as other SSRI drugs, it is most often used to treat obsessive-compulsive disorder.
Fluvoxamine has been in use in clinical practice since 1983 and has a clinical trial database comprised of approximately 35,000 patients. It was launched in the US in December 1994 and in Japan in June 1999. As of the end of 1995, more than 10 million patients worldwide have been treated with fluvoxamine."
DB00177,"Valsartan belongs to the angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) family of drugs, which also includes [telmisartan], [candesartan], [losartan], [olmesartan], and [irbesartan]. ARBs selectively bind to angiotensin receptor 1 (AT1) and prevent the protein angiotensin II from binding and exerting its hypertensive effects, which include vasoconstriction, stimulation and synthesis of aldosterone and ADH, cardiac stimulation, and renal reabsorption of sodium, among others. Overall, valsartan's physiologic effects lead to reduced blood pressure, lower aldosterone levels, reduced cardiac activity, and increased excretion of sodium. 

Valsartan also affects the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS), which plays an important role in hemostasis and regulation of kidney, vascular, and cardiac functions. Pharmacological blockade of RAAS via  AT1 receptor blockade inhibits negative regulatory feedback within RAAS, which is a contributing factor to the pathogenesis and progression of cardiovascular disease, heart failure, and renal disease. In particular, heart failure is associated with chronic activation of RAAS, leading to inappropriate fluid retention, vasoconstriction, and ultimately a further decline in left ventricular function. ARBs have been shown to have a protective effect on the heart by improving cardiac function, reducing afterload, increasing cardiac output and preventing ventricular hypertrophy and remodelling.[A174154] 

By comparison, the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) class of medications (which includes drugs such as [ramipril], [lisinopril], and [perindopril]) inhibit the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II through inhibition of the ACE enzyme. However, this does not prevent the formation of all angiotensin II within the body. The angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) family of drugs unique in that it blocks all angiotensin II activity, regardless of where or how it was synthesized. 

Valsartan is commonly used for the management of hypertension, heart failure, and Type 2 Diabetes-associated nephropathy, particularly in patients who are unable to tolerate ACE inhibitors. ARBs such as valsartan have been shown in a number of large-scale clinical outcomes trials to improve cardiovascular outcomes including reducing risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, the progression of heart failure, and hospitalization.[A174124,A178153,A173869,A185324,A185327,A185333,A185342,A185345] Valsartan also slows the progression of diabetic nephropathy due to its renoprotective effects.[A174157,A174160,A174163] Improvements in chronic kidney disease with valsartan include both clinically and statistically significant decreases in urinary albumin and protein excretion in patients diagnosed with type 2 diabetes and in nondiabetic patients diagnosed with chronic kidney disease.[A174124,A173869]

Valsartan was initially approved in 1996 in Europe for the treatment of hypertension in adults. Shortly after, in 1997, this drug was approved in the United States.[A174124] Valsartan is generally well-tolerated with a side-effect profile superior to that of other antihypertensive drugs.[A174130,A174133]"
DB00178,"Ramipril is a prodrug belonging to the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor class of medications. It is metabolized to ramiprilat in the liver and, to a lesser extent, kidneys. Ramiprilat is a potent, competitive inhibitor of ACE, the enzyme responsible for the conversion of angiotensin I (ATI) to angiotensin II (ATII). ATII regulates blood pressure and is a key component of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). Ramipril may be used in the treatment of hypertension, congestive heart failure, nephropathy, and to reduce the rate of death, myocardial infarction and stroke in individuals at high risk of cardiovascular events."

DB00181,"Baclofen is a gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) agonist used as a skeletal muscle relaxant. Although originally designed in 1962 to treat epilepsy, baclofen was not effective in treating this condition but instead was shown to reduce spasticity in selected patients.[A245338] Baclofen was reintroduced in 1971 as a treatment for spasticity and was later approved by the FDA in 1977.[A245323, A245338] Baclofen is used to manage severe muscle spasms of cerebral or spinal cord origins, including multiple sclerosis and traumatic brain injury.[L39429]

Baclofen was investigated for use in alcohol dependence and withdrawal; however, evidence is limited and there is inconsistent evidence to suggest its clinical efficacy in managing alcohol dependence or withdrawal symptoms.[A173905, A173908, A245338]"
DB00182,"Amphetamine, a compound discovered over 100 years ago, is one of the more restricted controlled drugs. It was previously used for a large variety of conditions and this changed until this point where its use is highly restricted. Amphetamine, with the chemical formula alpha-methylphenethylamine, was discovered in 1910 and first synthesized by 1927. After being proven to reduce drug-induced anesthesia and produce arousal and insomnia, amphetamine racemic mix was registered by Smith, Kline and French in 1935. Amphetamine structure presents one chiral center and it exists in the form of dextro- and levo-isomers.[A18540] The first product of Smith, Kline and French was approved by the FDA on 1976.[L5194]

During World War II, amphetamine was used to promote wakefulness in the soldiers. This use derived into a large overproduction of amphetamine and all the surplus after the war finalized ended up in the black market, producing the initiation of the illicit abuse.[A18540]"
DB00186,"Lorazepam is a short-acting and rapidly cleared benzodiazepine used commonly as a sedative and anxiolytic.[A957] It was developed by DJ Richards, presented and marketed initially by Wyeth Pharmaceuticals in the USA in 1977. The first historic FDA label approval is reported in 1985 by the company Mutual Pharm.[L5095]"
DB00187,"Esmolol, commonly marketed under the trade name Brevibloc, is a cardioselective beta-1 receptor blocker. It has a rapid onset but short duration of action without causing significant intrinsic sympathomimetic or membrane stabilizing activities at recommended therapeutic doses. It works by blocking beta-adrenergic receptors in the heart, which leads to decreased force and rate of heart contractions. Esmolol prevents the action of two naturally occurring substances: epinephrine and norepinephrine.

The FDA withdrew its approval for the use of all parenteral dosage form drug products containing esmolol hydrochloride that supply 250 milligrams/milliliter of concentrated esmolol per 10-milliliter ampule. Other esmolol formulations are still available for use.[L43942]"
DB00188,"Bortezomib is a dipeptide boronic acid derivative and proteasome inhibitor used to treat multiple myeloma and mantle cell lymphoma.[A204083] The 26S proteasome is a protein complex that degrades ubiquitinated proteins in the ubiquitin-proteasome pathway: reversible inhibition of the 26S proteasome, leading to cell cycle arrest and apoptosis of cancer cells, is thought to be the main mechanism of action of bortezomib.[L14180] However, multiple mechanisms may be involved in the anticancer activity of bortezomib.[A204083]

Bortezomib was first synthesized in 1995.[A204083] In May 2003, bortezomib became the first anticancer proteasome inhibitor that was approved by the FDA under the trade name VELCADE.[A204146] Phase I, II, III, and IV clinical trials are undergoing to investigate the therapeutic efficacy of bortezomib in leukemia, myasthenia gravis, systemic lupus erythematosus, rheumatoid arthritis, and solid tumours.[A214307]"
DB00190,"Carbidopa presents a chemical denomination of N-amino-alpha-methyl-3-hydroxy-L-tyrosine monohydrate. It potently inhibits aromatic amino acid decarboxylase (DDC) and due to its chemical properties, it does not cross the blood-brain barrier. Due to its activity, carbidopa is always administered concomitantly with [levodopa]. An individual formulation containing solely carbidopa was generated to treat nausea in patients where the combination therapy [levodopa]/carbidopa is not efficient reducing nausea.[T394] 

The first approved product by the FDA containing only carbidopa was developed by Amerigens Pharmaceuticals Ltd and approved on 2014.[L5110] On the other hand, the combination treatment of carbidopa/levodopa was originally developed by Watson Labs but the historical information by the FDA brings back to the approval of this combination therapy developed by Mayne Pharma in 1992.[L5113]"
DB00191,"Phentermine is a sympathomimetic amine anorectic agent and it was introduced in 1959 as part of an anti-obesity combination drug.[A174361, A174364] It is chemically related to amphetamine and it is commonly referred to as an atypical amphetamine.[A174370] Phentermine has not been reported an addictive potential which allows this agent to be classified under the Schedule IV drugs (low abuse potential).[A174367]

Phentermine was FDA approved for short-term weight management in 1959 and it became widely used in 1960. This initial product, formed by the combination of phentermine with [fenfluramine] and [dexfenfluramine] was discontinued after finding several reports of abnormal valves in nearly 30% of the consumers.[A174376, T403] Later on, phentermine was approved alone and in combination with topiramate in 2012 as a new alternative that required lower doses of phentermine to obtain the desired effect.[A174373]"
DB00193,"Tramadol is a centrally acting synthetic opioid analgesic and SNRI (serotonin/norepinephrine reuptake-inhibitor) that is structurally related to [codeine] and [morphine]. Due to its good tolerability profile and multimodal mechanism of action, tramadol is generally considered a lower-risk opioid option for the treatment of moderate to severe pain. It is considered a Step 2 option on the World Health Organization's pain ladder and has about 1/10th of the potency of [morphine]. 

Tramadol differs from other traditional opioid medications in that it doesn't just act as a μ-opioid agonist, but also affects monoamines by modulating the effects of neurotransmitters involved in the modulation of pain such as serotonin and norepinpehrine which activate descending pain inhibitory pathways.[A182279] Tramadol's effects on serotonin and norepinephrine mimic the effects of other SNRI antidepressants such as [duloxetine] and [venlafaxine].

Tramadol exists as a racemic mixture consisting of two pharmacologically active enantiomers that both contribute to its analgesic property through different mechanisms and are also themselves metabolized into active metabolites: (+)-tramadol and its primary metabolite (+)-O-desmethyl-tramadol (M1) are agonists of the μ opioid receptor while (+)-tramadol inhibits serotonin reuptake and (-)-tramadol inhibits norepinephrine reuptake. These pathways are complementary and synergistic, improving tramadol's ability to modulate the perception of and response to pain.[A4269,A183842] 

Tramadol has also been shown to affect a number of other pain modulators within the central nervous system as well as non-neuronal inflammatory markers and immune mediators.[A183728,A183734,A183761,A17159,A182300] Due to the broad spectrum of targets involved in pain and inflammation, it's not surprising that the evidence has shown that tramadol is effective for a number of pain types including neuropathic pain, post-operative pain, lower back pain, as well as pain associated with labour, osteoarthritis, fibromyalgia, and cancer. Due to its SNRI activity, tramadol also has anxiolytic, antidepressant, and anti-shivering effects which are all frequently found as comorbidities with pain.[A182300]

Similar to other opioid medications, tramadol poses a risk for development of tolerance, dependence and abuse. If used in higher doses, or with other opioids, there is a dose-related risk of overdose, respiratory depression, and death.[A183830,F4679] However, unlike other opioid medications, tramadol use also carries a risk of seizure and serotonin syndrome, particularly if used with other serotonergic medications.[A183836,A179926]"

DB00201,"Caffeine is a drug of the methylxanthine class used for a variety of purposes, including certain respiratory conditions of the premature newborn, pain relief, and to combat drowsiness. Caffeine is similar in chemical structure to [Theophylline] and [Theobromine].[A187691,L9851] It can be sourced from coffee beans, but also occurs naturally in various teas and cacao beans, which are different than coffee beans.[T716] Caffeine is also used in a variety of cosmetic products and can be administered topically, orally, by inhalation, or by injection.[T716]

The caffeine citrate injection, used for apnea of the premature newborn, was initially approved by the FDA in 1999.[L9863] According to an article from 2017, more than 15 million babies are born prematurely worldwide. This correlates to about 1 in 10 births. Premature birth can lead to apnea and bronchopulmonary dysplasia, a condition that interferes with lung development and may eventually cause asthma or early onset emphysema in those born prematurely.[A187694] Caffeine is beneficial in preventing and treating apnea and bronchopulmonary dysplasia in newborns, improving the quality of life of premature infants.[T716]"

The result of doing so allows cGMP present in both the penis and pulmonary vasculature to elicit smooth muscle relaxation and vasodilation that subsequently facilitates relief in pulmonary arterial hypertension and the increased flow of blood into the spongy erectile tissue of the penis that consequently allows it to grow in size and become erect and rigid [F3850, F3853, F3856, F3859, F3883, F3886, L5611, L5614].

Interestingly enough, it is precisely via this mechanism why sildenafil was at first researched as a potential treatment for angina - or chest pain associated with inadequate blood flow to the heart - before being serendipitously indicated for treating erectile dysfunction in the late 1980s [A175732]. Nevertheless, it is because of this mechanism that sildenafil is also indicated for treating pulmonary arterial hypertension but is also additionally notorious for interacting with various anti-anginal or anti-hypertensive agents to develop potentially rapid, excessive, and/or fatal hypotensive crises [A175579, A175582, A175654].

Regardless, sildenafil, among a variety of other similar or related PDE5 inhibitors, has become a common and effective treatment for erectile dysfunction and since its formal approval for medical use in the public in 1998 [A175732], continues to see millions of prescriptions written for it internationally. Although the medication has historically been most popularly recognized as Pfizer's brand name Viagra, sildenafil is currently available generically and even as a non-prescription over the counter medication in some countries [L5656]."

DB00210,"Acne vulgaris is a multifactorial disorder of the pilosebaceous unit involving increased sebum production, inflammation, and hyperproliferation/hyperkeratinization of the follicular infundibulum. It is also associated with _Cutibacterium acnes_ (also known as _Propionibacterium acnes_). Adapalene is a third-generation topical retinoid used for the treatment of acne vulgaris.[A193518] Adapalene has similar efficacy but a superior safety profile compared to tretinoin.[A193521] [Tazarotene] is more efficacious than adapalene but is designated as pregnancy category X and hence is contraindicated in pregnant women.[A193518] Adapalene can also be combined with benzoyl peroxide (BPO), which possesses bactericidal properties[A193524], and either adapalene alone, or adapalene BPO combination products, are commonly used to treat mild-to-severe acne.[A193518]

DB00213,"Pantoprazole is a first-generation proton pump inhibitor (PPI) used for the management of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), for gastric protection to prevent recurrence of stomach ulcers or gastric damage from chronic use of NSAIDs, and for the treatment of pathological hypersecretory conditions including Zollinger-Ellison (ZE) Syndrome. It can also be found in quadruple regimens for the treatment of _H. pylori_ infections along with other antibiotics including [amoxicillin], [clarithromycin], and [metronidazole], for example.[A177271][F4498] Its efficacy is considered similar to other medications within the PPI class including [omeprazole], [esomeprazole], [lansoprazole], [dexlansoprazole], and [rabeprazole].

Pantoprazole exerts its stomach acid-suppressing effects by preventing the final step in gastric acid production by covalently binding to sulfhydryl groups of cysteines found on the (H+, K+)-ATPase enzyme at the secretory surface of gastric parietal cell. This effect leads to inhibition of both basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion, irrespective of the stimulus. As the binding of pantoprazole to the (H+, K+)-ATPase enzyme is irreversible and new enzyme needs to be expressed in order to resume acid secretion, pantoprazole's duration of antisecretory effect persists longer than 24 hours.[FDA Label]

Due to their good safety profile and as several PPIs are available over the counter without a prescription, their current use in North America is widespread. Long term use of PPIs such as pantoprazole have been associated with possible adverse effects, however, including increased susceptibility to bacterial infections (including gastrointestinal _C. difficile_), reduced absorption of micronutrients including iron and B12, and an increased risk of developing hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia which may contribute to osteoporosis and bone fractures later in life.[A177571]

PPIs such as pantoprazole have also been shown to inhibit the activity of dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH), an enzyme necessary for cardiovascular health. DDAH inhibition causes a consequent accumulation of the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor asymmetric dimethylarginie (ADMA), which is thought to cause the association of PPIs with increased risk of cardiovascular events in patients with unstable coronary syndromes.[A177577, A177580]

Pantoprazole doses should be slowly lowered, or tapered, before discontinuing as rapid discontinuation of PPIs such as pantoprazole may cause a rebound effect and a short term increase in hypersecretion.[A177574]"

DB00222,"First introduced in 1995, glimepiride is a member of the second-generation sulfonylurea (SU) drug class used for the management of type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) to improve glycemic control. Type 2 diabetes is a metabolic disorder with increasing prevalences worldwide; it is characterized by insulin resistance in accordance with progressive β cell failure and long-term microvascular and macrovascular complications that lead to co-morbidities and mortalities. Sulfonylureas are one of the insulin secretagogues widely used for the management of type 2 diabetes to lower blood glucose levels. The main effect of SUs is thought to be effective when residual pancreatic β-cells are present,[A177715] as they work by stimulating the release of insulin from the pancreatic beta cells and they are also thought to exert extra-pancreatic effects, such as increasing the insulin-mediated peripheral glucose uptake.[A177709] 

Glimepiride works by stimulating the secretion of insulin granules from pancreatic islet beta cells by blocking ATP-sensitive potassium channels (K<SUB>ATP</SUB> channels) and causing depolarization of the beta cells. Compared to [glipizide], another second SU drug, glimepiride has a longer duration of action. It is sometimes classified as a third-generation SU because it has larger substitutions than other second-generation SUs.[A177703] Compared to other SUs, glimepiride was associated with a lower risk of developing hypoglycemia and weight gain in clinical trials [A177709] as well as fewer cardiovascular effects than other SUs due to minimal effects on ischemic preconditioning of cardiac myocytes.[A177703] It is effective in reducing fasting plasma glucose, postprandial glucose, and glycosylated hemoglobin levels and is considered to be a useful, cost-effective treatment option for managing type 2 diabetes mellitus.[A177703] Glimepiride was approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) in the United States in 1995 for the treatment of T2DM. It is commonly marketed under the brand name Amaryl as oral tablets and is typically administered once daily."

DB00227,"Lovastatin, also known as the brand name product Mevacor, is a lipid-lowering drug and fungal metabolite derived synthetically from a fermentation product of _Aspergillus terreus_.[A174550] Originally named Mevinolin, lovastatin belongs to the statin class of medications, which are used to lower the risk of cardiovascular disease and manage abnormal lipid levels by inhibiting the endogenous production of cholesterol in the liver.[A174553] More specifically, statin medications competitively inhibit the enzyme hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) Reductase,[A181421] which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonic acid and is the third step in a sequence of metabolic reactions involved in the production of several compounds involved in lipid metabolism and transport including cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (sometimes referred to as ""bad cholesterol""), and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL). Prescribing of statin medications is considered standard practice following any cardiovascular events and for people with a moderate to high risk of development of CVD, such as those with Type 2 Diabetes. The clear evidence of the benefit of statin use coupled with very minimal side effects or long term effects has resulted in this class becoming one of the most widely prescribed medications in North America.[A181087, A181406]

Lovastatin and other drugs from the statin class of medications including [atorvastatin], [pravastatin], [rosuvastatin], [fluvastatin], and [simvastatin] are considered first-line options for the treatment of dyslipidemia.[A181087, A181406] Increasing use of the statin class of drugs is largely due to the fact that cardiovascular disease (CVD), which includes heart attack, atherosclerosis, angina, peripheral artery disease, and stroke, has become a leading cause of death in high-income countries and a major cause of morbidity around the world.[A181084] Elevated cholesterol levels, and in particular, elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, are an important risk factor for the development of CVD.[A181087,A181553] Use of statins to target and reduce LDL levels has been shown in a number of landmark studies to significantly reduce the risk of development of CVD and all-cause mortality.[A181090,A181093,A181096,A181427,A181475,A181538] Statins are considered a cost-effective treatment option for CVD due to their evidence of reducing all-cause mortality including fatal and non-fatal CVD as well as the need for surgical revascularization or angioplasty following a heart attack.[A181087, A181406] Evidence has shown that even for low-risk individuals (with <10% risk of a major vascular event occurring within 5 years) statins cause a 20%-22% relative reduction in major cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke, coronary revascularization, and coronary death) for every 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL without any significant side effects or risks.[A181397, A181403]

While all statin medications are considered equally effective from a clinical standpoint, [rosuvastatin] is considered the most potent; doses of 10 to 40mg [rosuvastatin] per day were found in clinical studies to result in a 45.8% to 54.6% decrease in LDL cholesterol levels, while lovastatin has been found to have an average decrease in LDL-C of 25-40%.[A174580,A181409,A181535,A181538,A1793] Potency is thought to correlate to tissue permeability as the more lipophilic statins such as lovastatin are thought to enter endothelial cells by passive diffusion, as opposed to hydrophilic statins such as [pravastatin] and [rosuvastatin] which are taken up into hepatocytes through OATP1B1 (organic anion transporter protein 1B1)-mediated transport.[A181424,A181460] Despite these differences in potency, several trials have demonstrated only minimal differences in terms of clinical outcomes between statins.[A181538, A181427]"

It is a short-to-intermediate acting member of barbiturates that exhibit muscle-relaxing and anti-anxiety properties that produce central nervous system (CNS) depression that ranges from mild sedation to general anesthesia.[A177754] Butalbital has a low degree of selectivity and a narrow therapeutic index.[A177754] Typically indicated to manage tension (or muscle contraction) headaches, butalbital is often combined with one or more therapeutic agents, such as acetylsalicylic acid, acetaminophen, aspirin, and caffeine. There have not been clinical trials that evaluate the clinical efficacy of butalbital in migraines [A177754] thus it is not indicated for such condition. As with other barbiturates, butalbital carries a risk of abuse or misuse potential, intoxication, hangover, tolerance, dependence, and overdosage possibly leading to death.[L10370] Butalbital‐containing analgesics can also produce a drug‐induced headache in addition to tolerance and dependence. Due to these risks, the use of butalbital-containing combination products is typically limited for use only in cases where other medications are deemed ineffective and such usage is advised to be carefully monitored.[A177754]"

The generation of structure-activity relationships proved that benztropine derivatives with the presence of a chlorine substituent in the para position in one of the phenyl rings produces an increased potency for dopamine uptake inhibition as well as a decreased inhibition of serotonin and norepinephrine.[A37914] Benztropine was developed by USL Pharma and officially approved by the FDA on 1996.[L5500]"
DB00246,"Disorders such as schizophrenia and bipolar disorder can significantly impair mood, cognition, and behavior.[A190525] These mental illnesses can often be accompanied by comorbidities such as depression and substance abuse, and can significantly impact the quality of life of patients and caregivers.[A190525] Luckily, several treatment options for psychotic disorders have been introduced to market since the realization of chlorpromazine's antipsychotic properties in 1952.[A190525] 

Second generation antipsychotics (commonly referred to as atypical antipsychotics) include [clozapine], [quetiapine], [olanzapine], [aripiprazole] and [ziprasidone] among others, and are generally thought to be as efficacious as first generation antipsychotics but differ in their adverse effect profiles.[A190525,A190534] First generation antipsychotics are associated with extrapyramidal adverse effects while atypical antipsychotics are linked to weight gain, impaired glucose tolerance and metabolic syndrome.[A190534,A190537] 

Ziprasidone is used to treat schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.[A180748] It can effectively reduce the rate and time of relapses in schizophrenia, and can be used to treat manic episodes in bipolar disorder although the mechanism of action is unknown.[A180748] Although ziprasidone is classified as an atypical antipsychotic, it appears to have a lower incidence of metabolic adverse effects compared to other medications in the same class.[A190525]"

It is structurally related to felodipine, nifedipine, and nimodipine and is the most potent calcium-channel blocking agent of the DHP class. Isradipine binds to calcium channels with high affinity and specificity and inhibits calcium flux into cardiac and arterial smooth muscle cells. It exhibits greater selectivity towards arterial smooth muscle cells owing to alternative splicing of the alpha-1 subunit of the channel and increased prevalence of inactive channels in smooth muscle cells. Isradipine may be used to treat mild to moderate essential hypertension."

DB00275,"Olmesartan belongs to the angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) family of drugs, which also includes [telmisartan], [candesartan], [losartan], [valsartan], and [irbesartan]. ARBs selectively bind to angiotensin receptor 1 (AT1) and prevent the protein angiotensin II from binding and exerting its hypertensive effects, which include vasoconstriction, stimulation and synthesis of aldosterone and ADH, cardiac stimulation, and renal reabsorption of sodium, among others. Overall, olmesartan's physiologic effects lead to reduced blood pressure, lower aldosterone levels, reduced cardiac activity, and increased excretion of sodium. 

Olmesartan also affects the renin-angiotensin aldosterone system (RAAS), which plays an important role in hemostasis and regulation of kidney, vascular, and cardiac functions. Pharmacological blockade of RAAS via  AT1 receptor blockade inhibits negative regulatory feedback within RAAS, which is a contributing factor to the pathogenesis and progression of cardiovascular disease, heart failure, and renal disease. In particular, heart failure is associated with chronic activation of RAAS, leading to inappropriate fluid retention, vasoconstriction, and ultimately a further decline in left ventricular function. ARBs have been shown to have a protective effect on the heart by improving cardiac function, reducing afterload, increasing cardiac output and preventing ventricular hypertrophy and remodelling.[A174154] 

By comparison, the angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEi) class of medications (which includes drugs such as [ramipril], [lisinopril], and [perindopril]) inhibit the conversion of angiotensin I to angiotensin II through inhibition of the ACE enzyme. However, this does not prevent the formation of all angiotensin II within the body. The angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) family of drugs unique in that it blocks all angiotensin II activity, regardless of where or how it was synthesized. 

Olmesartan is commonly used for the management of hypertension and Type 2 Diabetes-associated nephropathy, particularly in patients who are unable to tolerate ACE inhibitors. ARBs such as olmesartan have been shown in a number of large-scale clinical outcomes trials to improve cardiovascular outcomes including reducing risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, the progression of heart failure, and hospitalization.[A174124,A178153,A173869,A185324,A185327,A185333,A185342,A185345] Like other ARBs, olmesartan blockade of RAAS slows the progression of diabetic nephropathy due to its renoprotective effects.[A185906,A185909,A185912] 

Orally available olmesartan is produced as the prodrug olmesartan medoxomil which is rapidly converted _in vivo_ to the pharmacologically active olmesartan.[A175330] It was developed by Daiichi Sankyo Pharmaceuticals and approved in 2002.[A175345, L12882]"

DB00281,"Ever since its discovery and availability for sale and use in the late 1940s, lidocaine has become an exceptionally commonly used medication [T583]. In particular, lidocaine's principal mode of action in acting as a local anesthetic that numbs the sensations of tissues means the agent is indicated for facilitating local anesthesia for a large variety of surgical procedures [F4349, L5930, L5948]. It ultimately elicits its numbing activity by blocking sodium channels so that the neurons of local tissues that have the medication applied on are transiently incapable of signaling the brain regarding sensations [F4349, L5930, L5948]. In doing so, however, it can block or decrease muscle contractile, resulting in effects like vasodilation, hypotension, and irregular heart rate, among others [F4349, L5930, L5948]. As a result, lidocaine is also considered a class Ib anti-arrhythmic agent [L5930, L5948, F4468]. Nevertheless, lidocaine's local anesthetic action sees its use in many medical situations or circumstances that may benefit from its action, including the treatment of premature ejaculation [A177625].

DB00284,"Acarbose is a complex oligosaccharide that acts as an inhibitor of several enzymes responsible for the breakdown of complex carbohydrates in the intestines. It inhibits both pancreatic alpha-amylase and membrane-bound alpha-glucosidases - including intestinal glucoamylase, sucrase, maltase, and isomaltase - which are responsible for the metabolism of complex starches and oligo-, tri-, and disaccharides into absorbable simple sugars.[L31633,A37868] By inhibiting the activity of these enzymes, acarbose limits the absorption of dietary carbohydrates and the subsequent postprandial increase in blood glucose and insulin levels. Acarbose is therefore used in conjunction with diet, exercise, and other pharmacotherapies for the management of blood sugar levels in patients with type 2 diabetes.[L31628,L31633]

Acarbose is one of only two approved alpha-glucosidase inhibitors (the other being [miglitol]), receiving its first FDA approval in 1995 under the brand name Precose (since discontinued).[L31668] This class of antidiabetic therapy is not widely used due to their relatively modest impact on A1c, their requirement for thrice-daily dosing, and the potential for significant gastrointestinal adverse effects.[L31668]"
DB00285,"Venlafaxine is an antidepressant and a serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI). Its active metabolite, [desvenlafaxine], works by blocking the reuptake of serotonin and norepinephrine, which are key neurotransmitters in mood regulation. Venlafaxine is officially approved to treat major depressive disorder (MDD), generalized anxiety disorder (GAD), social anxiety disorder, and panic disorder in adults.[L43030] The immediate formulation of the drug, marketed as Effexor, was first approved by the FDA in 1993 and the extended-release formulation, Effexor XR, was later introduced in 1997.[A252065]

Venlafaxine has been used as a first-line treatment for MDD, GAD, social anxiety disorder, and panic disorder in Canada for many years. It was also considered a second-line treatment for obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD).[A177226,A177235] Venlafaxine was also investigated in off-label uses for the prophylaxis of migraine headaches,[A413,A177229] for reduction of vasomotor symptoms associated with menopause,[A177238] and for the management of neuropathic pain (although there is only minimal evidence of efficacy for this condition).[A177232]"
DB00286,"The conjugated estrogens are noncrystalline mixtures of purified female sex hormones obtained either by its isolation from the urine of pregnant mares or by synthetic generation from vegetal material. Both of these products are later conjugated to natrium sulfate by ester bonds in order to make them more water soluble.[L5605, T475] 

The conjugated estrogen product contains a mix of estrogen from which about 50% is represented by estrone sulfate followed by 25% of equilin sulfate, 15% of 17-alpha-dehydroequilenin sulfate, 3% of equilenin sulfate, 5% of 17-alpha and 17-beta-dihydroequilenin sulfate, 2% of 17-alpha-estradiolsulfate and 3% of 17-beta-estradiolsulfate. It also presents a large number of unidentified molecules with weak estrogenic activity as well as non-human molecules when it is obtained from pregnant mares urine.[T475] 

The conjugated estrogen mixture was approved for marketing in US in 1942 based on the efficacy against certain conditions. However, until 1986 official clinical trials were performed and this product was determined to be effective for the treatment of osteoporosis.[T484] The currently approved product of conjugated estrogens was developed by Wyeth Ayerst and FDA approved in 2003.[L5608]"
DB00287,"Travoprost is a synthetic isopropyl ester prodrug of a prostaglandin F2alpha (F2α) analogue and selective FP prostanoid receptor agonist. It is used to decrease intraocular pressure in open-angle glaucoma and ocular hypertension.[L49434] Unlike other prostaglandin analogues, travoprost demonstrates full agonism and high selectivity at the prostanoid receptor, reporting a higher efficacy in reducing intraocular pressure and a reduced risk for developing off-target side effects.[A262904]"
DB00289,"Atomoxetine is a selective norepinephrine (NE) reuptake inhibitor used for the treatment of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Also known as the marketed product Strattera, atomoxetine is used with other treatment modalities (psychological, educational, cognitive behaviour therapy, etc) to improve developmentally inappropriate symptoms associated with ADHD including distractibility, short attention span, hyperactivity, emotional lability, and impulsivity. Although the underlying pathophysiology that causes ADHD remains unclear, evidence suggests that dysregulation in noradrenergic and dopaminergic pathways plays a critical role in suboptimal executive functioning within prefrontal regions of the brain, which are involved in attention and memory.[A178090] Atomoxetine has been shown to specifically increase NA and DA within the prefrontal cortex, but not in the nucleus accumbens (NA) or striatum.[A18262] This is beneficial in the treatment of ADHD as DA activation in the subcortical NA and striatum is associated with many stimulant-associated side effects and an increase in abuse potential, which is a limiting factor associated with the use of stimulant medications such as [DB00422], [DB01576], and [DB01255].[A18262] Use of non-stimulant medications such as atomoxetine is therefore thought to offer a clinical advantage over the use of traditional medications for the management of ADHD. More recently, positron emission tomography (PET) imaging studies in rhesus monkeys have shown that atomoxetine also binds to the serotonin transporter (SERT),[A178111] and blocks the N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor,[A18263] indicating a role for the glutamatergic system in the pathophysiology of ADHD. 

Long-acting formulations of psychostimulants (such as [DB00422], [DB01576], and [DB01255]) are typically considered the most effective and first-line treatment for ADHD in adults and children as recommended by CADDRA (Canadian ADHD Resource Alliance).[L6037] However, these stimulant medications are limited by dose-related side effects and concerns of abuse. Many contain a blackbox warning stating that CNS stimulants, including methylphenidate-containing products and amphetamines, have a high potential for abuse and dependence. In particular, increased dopamine in key areas caused by these stimulant medications is associated with their reinforcing and addictive properties, and even amplifies the potency and reinforcing effects of other drugs of abuse such as amphetamines, making ADHD sufferers more susceptible to their addictive effects.[A177556] Concerns about abuse potential have spurred research into medications with fewer effects on DA and the use of non-stimulant ADHD medications including atomoxetine, [DB00745] and [DB01018]. The non-stimulant norepinephrine/dopamine reuptake inhibitor [DB01156] (commonly used for the treatment of depression and for smoking cessation) has also been shown to be effective in the treatment of ADHD.[A178099]"

DB00310,"Chlorthalidone is a thiazide-like diuretic used for the treatment of hypertension and for management of edema caused by conditions such as heart failure or renal impairment. Chlorthalidone improves blood pressure and swelling by preventing water absorption from the kidneys through inhibition of the Na+/Cl− symporter in the distal convoluted tubule cells in the kidney. The exact mechanism of chlorthalidone's anti-hypertensive effect is under debate, however, it is thought that increased diuresis results in decreased plasma and extracellular fluid volume, decreased cardiac output and therefore overall reduction in blood pressure.[A176324]

Chlorthalidone is considered first-line therapy for management of uncomplicated hypertension as there is strong evidence from meta-analyses that thiazide diuretics such as chlorthalidone reduce the risk of stroke, myocardial infarction, heart failure, and cardiovascular all-cause mortality in patients with hypertension.[A173863] In particular, the ALLHAT trial confirmed the role of thiazide diuretics as first-line therapy and demonstrated that chlorthalidone had a statistically significant lower incidence of stroke and heart failure when compared to [DB00722], [DB00381], or [DB00590].[A173884, A173887] Further studies have indicated that low-dose thiazides are as good as, and in some secondary endpoints, better than β-blockers, ACE inhibitors, Calcium Channel Blockers or ARBs.

Chlorthalidone has been shown to have a number of pleiotropic effects that differentiate it from other diuretics such as [DB00999]. In addition to its antihypertensive effects, chlorthalidone has also been shown to decrease platelet aggregation and vascular permeability, as well as promote angiogenesis in vitro, which is thought to be partly the result of reductions in carbonic anhydrase–dependent pathways. These pathways may play a role in chlorthalidone's cardiovascular risk reduction effects.[A176330]"
DB00313,"Valproic acid, or valproate, is an fatty acid derivative and anticonvulsant originally synthesized in 1881 by Beverly S.

DB00328,"Indometacin, or indomethacin, is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with anti-inflammatory, analgesic, and antipyretic properties. NSAIDs consist of agents that are structurally unrelated; the NSAID chemical classification of indometacin is an indole-acetic acid derivative with the chemical name 1- (p-chlorobenzoyl)25-methoxy-2-methylindole-3-acetic acid.[A177871] The pharmacological effect of indometacin is not fully understood, however, it is thought to be mediated through potent and nonselective inhibition of the enzyme cyclooxygenase (COX), which is the main enzyme responsible for catalyzes the rate-limiting step in prostaglandin and thromboxane biosynthesis via the arachidonic acid (AA) pathway. Indometacin was first discovered in 1963 and it was first approved for use in the U.S. by the Food and Drug Administration in 1965, [A486] along with other acetic acid derivatives such as [diclofenac] and [sulindac] that were also developed during the 1960s.[A177871] Since then, indometacin has been extensively studied in clinical trials as one of the most potent NSAIDs in blocking prostaglandin synthesis and was among the first NSAIDs to be used in the symptomatic treatment of migraine and for headaches that eventually became known as “indomethacin-responsive” headache disorders.[A177871] 

Most commonly used in rheumatoid arthritis, ankylosing spondylitis, osteoarthritis, acute shoulder pains, and acute gouty arthritis, indometacin is currently available as oral capsules as well as other methods of administration, including rectal and intravenous formulations. Intravenous indometacin is administered to close a hemodynamically significant patent ductus arteriosus, as indicated by clinical evidence, in premature infants.[L10553] Ophthalmic indometacin has been studied and used in the symptomatic treatment of postoperative ocular inflammation and pain and/or complications after cataract surgery. Although deemed effective in reducing ocular inflammation in clinical studies, topical NSAIDs were also associated with a potential reduction in corneal sensitivity accompanied by an increased risk of superficial punctate keratitis and subjective symptoms of discomfort, including pain, burning or pricking, or a tingling sensation after instillation into the cul‐de‐sac.[A177949]"
DB00331,"Metformin is a biguanide antihyperglycemic agent and first-line pharmacotherapy used in the management of type II diabetes.[L12207,A176173] 

Metformin is considered an antihyperglycemic drug because it lowers blood glucose concentrations in type II diabetes without causing hypoglycemia. It is commonly described as an ""insulin sensitizer"", leading to a decrease in insulin resistance and a clinically significant reduction of plasma fasting insulin levels.[A176173] Another well-known benefit of this drug is modest weight loss, making it an effective choice for obese patients type II diabetes.[A36559]

Ipratropium as a therapeutic agent was developed by Boehringer Ingelheim and its first monotherapy product was FDA approved in 1986, while the combination product of ipratropium and [albuterol] was approved in 1996.[L5894, L5891]"
DB00333,"Methadone is a potent synthetic analgesic that works as a full µ-opioid receptor (MOR) agonist and N-methyl-d-aspartate (NMDA) receptor antagonist. As a full MOR agonist, methadone mimics the natural effects of the body's opioids, endorphins, and enkephalins through the release of neurotransmitters involved in pain transmission. It also has a number of unique characteristics that have led to its increased use in the last two decades; in particular, methadone has a lower risk of neuropsychiatric toxicity compared to other opioids (due to a lack of active metabolites), minimal accumulation in renal failure, good bioavailability, low cost, and a long duration of action.[F4685,F4688,F4691,A185885,A185900,A185903] 

Due to its unique mechanism of action, methadone is particularly useful for the management of hard to treat pain syndromes such as neuropathic pain and cancer pain requiring higher and more frequent doses of shorter-acting opioids.[A185888,A185891,A185897] Compared with [morphine], the gold standard reference opioid, methadone also acts as an agonist of κ- and σ-opioid receptors, as an antagonist of the N-methyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptor, and as an inhibitor of serotonin and norepinephrine uptake.[A497,A5344] Specifically by inhibiting the NMDA receptor, methadone dampens a major excitatory pain pathway within the central nervous system.[A185876] Compared to other opioids, methadone's effects on NMDA inhibition may explain it's improved analgesic efficacy and reduced opioid tolerance.[A185891,A185894]

Methadone shares similar effects and risks of other opioids such as [morphine], [hydromorphone], [oxycodone], and [fentanyl]. However, it also has a unique pharmacokinetic profile. Compared with short-acting and even extended-release formulations of [morphine], methadone displays a comparatively longer duration of action and half-life. These effects make methadone a good option for the treatment of severe pain and addiction as fewer doses are needed to maintain analgesia and prevent opioid withdrawal symptoms. However, methadone also has an unpredictable half-life with interindividual variability, which leads to an unpredictable risk of respiratory depression and overdose when initiating or titrating therapy.[A183995]

Overall, methadone's pharmacological actions result in analgesia, suppression of opioid withdrawal symptoms, sedation, miosis, sweating, hypotension, bradycardia, nausea and vomiting (via binding within the chemoreceptor trigger zone), and constipation. At higher doses, methadone use can result in respiratory depression, overdose, and death.[F4685,F4688,F4691]

Treatment of opioid addiction with methadone, [buprenorphine], or slow-release oral [morphine] (SROM) is termed Opioid Agonist Treatment (OAT) or Opioid Substitution Therapy (OST). The intention of substitution of illicit opioids with the long-acting opioids used in OAT is to prevent withdrawal symptoms for 24-36 hours following dosing to ultimately reduce cravings and drug-seeking behaviours. Use of OAT is also intended to lead to social stabilization by reducing crime rates, incarceration, use of illicit opioids such as [heroin] or [fentanyl], and ultimately marginalization.[A185882] Illegally purchased opioids present many other harms in addition to overdose as they can be injected and may be laced with other substances that increase the risk of harm or overdose. Provision of OAT is often combined with education about harm reduction including use of clean needles and injection supplies in an effort to reduce the risks associated with injection drug use such as contraction of HIV and Hepatitis C and other complications including skin infections, abscesses, or endocarditis."
DB00334,"Olanzapine is a thienobenzodiazepine classified as an atypical or second-generation antipsychotic agent.[A176996] The second-generation antipsychotics were introduced in the 90s and quickly gained traction due to their impressive efficacy, reduced risk for extrapyramidal side effects and reduced susceptibility to drug-drug interactions.[A177011] Olanzapine very closely resembles [clozapine] and only differs by two additional methyl groups and the absence of a chloride moiety.[T554] It was discovered by scientists at Eli Lilly and approved to be marketed in the US in 1996.[T548]"
DB00335,"Atenolol is a cardioselective beta-blocker used in a variety of cardiovascular conditions. 

Sir James Black, a Scottish pharmacologist, pioneered the use of beta-blockers for the management of angina pectoris in 1958 for which he received the Nobel Prize.[A178429] Beta-blockers quickly became popular in clinical use and where subsequently investigated for use in myocardial infarction, arrhythmias, and hypertension during the 1960s. Later they continued to be investigated for use in heart failure throughout the 1970-1980s. Atenolol itself was developed early on in this history by Alvogen Malta under the trade name Tenormin and received FDA approval in September, 1981.[label]

Despite being one of the most widely prescribed beta blockers, evidence suggests atenolol may not significantly reduce mortality, and only modestly reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease in patients with hypertension.[A235850,A235855] A Cochrane review of patients being treated for primary hypertension shows that atenolol shows a risk ratio of 0.88 for cardiovascular disease risk and a risk ratio of 0.99 for mortality.[A235850,A235855] Similar results have been found in other meta-analyses.[A235860,A235865] A meta-analysis of over 145,000 patients showed the risk of stroke in patients taking atenolol may depend on the age of the patient.[A235865] The use of atenolol may need to be based on more patient factors than hypertension alone.[A235850,A235855,A235860,A235865]"

DB00361,"Vinorelbine is an anti-mitotic chemotherapy drug that is used in the treatment of several types of malignancies, including breast cancer and non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) [L1998].  It was initially approved in the USA in 1990's for the treatment of NSCLC [L2010].

It is a third-generation vinca alkaloid. The introduction of third-generation drugs (vinorelbine, gemcitabine, taxanes) in platinum combination improved survival of patients with advanced NSCLC, with very similar results from the various drugs. Treatment toxicities are considerable in the combination treatment setting [A32347].

A study was done on the clearance rate of vinorelbine on individuals with various single polymorphonuclear mutations.  It was found that there was 4.3-fold variation in vinorelbine clearance across the cohort, suggesting a strong influence of genetics on the clearance of this drug [L2002]."
DB00363,"Clozapine is a tricyclic dibenzodiazepine, classified as an atypical antipsychotic agent.[A256708] Clozapine displays affinity to various neuroreceptors with a particularly low affinity to the dopamine receptors, thus breaking the mold of first-generation antipsychotics and deeming it ""atypical"".[A256723]. This low affinity to dopamine receptors results in fewer extrapyramidal side effects, especially tardive dyskinesia.[A185747] However, its promiscuity toward the muscarinic and adrenergic receptors can result in other side effects, notably gastrointestinal hypomotility and orthostatic hypotension. [L905,A215552]. Despite its effectiveness in treating both positive and negative symptoms of schizophrenia, clozapine was briefly removed from the market in various jurisdictions in 1970 due to severe agranulocytosis.[A256713,A256718] However, continued evidence of its effectiveness led to clozapine's eventual reintroduction, although with a reluctance to prescribe it.[A256718] 

Clozapine was approved by the FDA in 1989 for treatment-resistant schizophrenia under the brand CLOZARIL.[L905] Due to its severe adverse effects profile, clozapine is only available through a restricted program under a Risk Evaluation Mitigation Strategy (REMS) called the Clozapine REMS Program.[L905]"
DB00364,"Sucralfate is a medication that is widely used to prevent and treat a number of diseases in the gastrointestinal tract such as duodenal ulcers [FDA label], gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD), gastritis, peptic ulcer disease, stress ulcer, in addition to dyspepsia [A177655].  It is considered a _cytoprotective agent_, protecting cells in the gastrointestinal tract from damage caused by agents such as gastric acid, bile salts, alcohol, and acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), among other substances [A177655, F4519].

Sucralfate has been shown to be a well-tolerated and safe drug. It is sold under many brands and is available in both tablet and suspension forms.  It was approved by the FDA  1982 in tablet form, and in 1994 for the suspension form [L6073, L6076]."

Some of these devices are known as Jaydess, Kyleena, and Mirena.  A subdermal implant of levonorgestrel that slowly releases the hormone over a long-term period is also available.[L7823]  In addition to the above uses, levonorgestrel is used as a component of long-term combination contraceptives.[A181991,L7760,L7778] 

Globally, levonorgestrel is the most commonly used emergency contraceptive. It was initially granted FDA approval in 1982 and was the first emergency contraceptive containing only progesterone, showing high levels of efficacy and a lack of estrogenic adverse effects when compared to older emergency contraceptive regimens.[A181976,A181994,L7760]"
DB00368,Precursor of epinephrine that is secreted by the adrenal medulla and is a widespread central and autonomic neurotransmitter.

It is also found in plants and is used pharmacologically as a sympathomimetic.
DB00371,"A carbamate with hypnotic, sedative, and some muscle relaxant properties, although in therapeutic doses reduction of anxiety rather than a direct effect may be responsible for muscle relaxation. Meprobamate has been reported to have anticonvulsant actions against petit mal seizures, but not against grand mal seizures (which may be exacerbated). It is used in the treatment of anxiety disorders, and also for the short-term management of insomnia but has largely been superseded by the benzodiazepines.

DB00374,"Treprostinil is a stable tricyclic analogue of prostacyclin[A248770] that promotes the vasodilation of pulmonary and systemic arterial vascular beds and the inhibition of platelet aggregation.[L41855,L41860,L41865] It reduces symptoms in patients with pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and pulmonary hypertension associated with interstitial lung disease.[L41855,L41860] The first agent approved for the treatment of PAH was [epoprostenol], a synthetic prostacyclin that significantly increases patients' quality of life. However, the use of epoprostenol is limited due to its short half-life (3-5 min) and instability at room temperature.[A248770,A248775] The use of more stable alternatives such as treprostinil provides patients with PAH with more treatment options.

Treprostinil was approved by the FDA in 2002 for the treatment of pulmonary arterial hypertension.[L41860] It is available in the following routes of administration: subcutaneous, intravenous, inhaled and oral. The first generic form of treprostinil became available in 2019.[A248775]"
DB00376,"Trihexyphenidyl is a centrally acting muscarinic antagonist used for treatment of parkinsonism and drug-induced extrapyramidal disorders.[L31773,L31778] Its discovery was published in 1949 in a study looking for drugs with antispasmodic activity.[A229103] Trihexyphenidyl is rarely used in the treatment of parkinsonism, and is not a first line treatment due to significant adverse effects.[L31843] It has largely been replaced by drugs such as [levodopa].[L31843]

Trihexyphenidyl was granted FDA approval on 13 May 1949.[L31768]"

DB00381,"Amlodipine, initially approved by the FDA in 1987, is a popular antihypertensive drug belonging to the group of drugs called _dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers_.  Due to their selectivity for the peripheral blood vessels, dihydropyridine calcium channel blockers are associated with a lower incidence of myocardial depression and cardiac conduction abnormalities than other calcium channel blockers [A175327].

Amlodipine is commonly used in the treatment of high blood pressure and angina. Amlodipine has antioxidant properties and an ability to enhance the production of nitric oxide (NO), an important vasodilator that decreases blood pressure [A175321].  The option for single daily dosing of amlodipine is an attractive feature of this drug [FDA label]."
DB00382,"A centerally active cholinesterase inhibitor that has been used to counter the effects of muscle relaxants, as a respiratory stimulant, and in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease and other central nervous system disorders. Tacrine has been discontinued for the United States market."
DB00384,"Triamterene (2,4,7-triamino-6-phenylpteridine) is a potassium-sparing diuretic that is used in the management of hypertension. It works by promoting the excretion of sodium ions and water while decreasing the potassium excretion in the distal part of the nephron in the kidneys by working on the lumenal side.[A177985] Since it acts on the distal nephron where only a small fraction of sodium ion reabsorption occurs, triamterene is reported to have limited diuretic efficacy.[T28] Due to its effects on increased serum potassium levels, triamterene is associated with a risk of producing hyperkalemia. Triamterene is a weak antagonist of folic acid, and a photosensitizing drug.[L6163] 

Triamterene was approved by the Food and Drug Administration in the U.S. in 1964.[L6163] Currently, triamterene is used in the treatment of edema associated with various conditions as monotherapy and is approved for use with other diuretics to enhance diuretic and potassium-sparing effects.[L6166] It is also found in a combination product with hydrochlorothiazide that is used for the management of hypertension or treatment of edema in patients who develop hypokalemia on hydrochlorothiazide alone."

DB00390,"Digoxin is one of the oldest cardiovascular medications used today.[A178225] It is a common agent used to manage atrial fibrillation and the symptoms of heart failure.[A178234] Digoxin is classified as a cardiac glycoside and was initially approved by the FDA in 1954.[L9143]

This drug originates from the foxglove plant, also known as the _Digitalis_ plant[T610], studied by William Withering, an English physician and botanist in the 1780s.[A178237,A178240] Prior to this, a Welsh family, historically referred to as the _Physicians of Myddvai_, formulated drugs from this plant. They were one of the first to prescribe cardiac glycosides, according to ancient literature dating as early as the 1250s.[A178240]"
DB00393,"Nimodipine is a 1,4-dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker. It acts primarily on vascular smooth muscle cells by stabilizing voltage-gated L-type calcium channels in their inactive conformation. By inhibiting the influx of calcium in smooth muscle cells, nimodipine prevents calcium-dependent smooth muscle contraction and subsequent vasoconstriction. Compared to other calcium channel blocking agents, nimodipine exhibits greater effects on cerebral circulation than on peripheral circulation. Nimodipine is used to as an adjunct to improve the neurologic outcome following subarachnoid hemorrhage from ruptured intracranial aneurysm."
DB00394,"Beclomethasone dipropionate is a second-generation[A179842] synthetic corticosteroid and diester of beclomethasone, which is structurally similar to [dexamethasone].[L6871] It is a prodrug of an active metabolite beclomethasone 17-monopropionate (17-BMP)[A179839] which acts on the glucocorticoid receptor to mediates its therapeutic action. Beclomethasone dipropionate itself posesses weak glucocorticoid receptor binding affinity and is rapidly converted into 17-BMP upon administration.[A179839] Formulations for oral inhalation, intranasal, and topical use are available for beclomethasone dipropionate. Beclomethasone dipropionate became first available in a pressurized metered-dose inhaler in 1972 and later in a dry powder inhaler and an aqueous nasal spray.[A179839] Due to its anti-inflammatory, antipruritic, and anti-allergy properties, beclomethasone dipropionate is used in various inflammatory conditions, such as asthma, allergic rhinitis, and dermatoses to reduce symptoms. When inhaled, it is proposed that beclomethasone dipropionate remains active locally in the lung without causing significant side effects associated with systemic corticosteroids.[A180010] Compared to earlier corticosteroids such as [dexamethasone] and [prednisolone], beclomethasone dipropionate is reported to be less irritating to the nasal mucosa with a longer duration of action when administered intranasally.[A179848]"
DB00396,"Progesterone is a hormone that occurs naturally in females, and is essential for endometrial receptivity, embryo implantation, and the successful establishment of pregnancy. A low progesterone concentration or an insufficient response to progesterone can cause infertility and pregnancy loss [A175609]. Progesterone is used in various contraceptive preparations to prevent ovulation and fertilization [T481], [A175612] as well as in other formulations to promote and support pregnancy.  Please see [Medroxyprogesterone acetate], [Megestrol acetate], [Dydrogesterone] and [Hydroxyprogesterone] entries for information on various other forms of progesterone.

DB00412,"Rosiglitazone is an anti-diabetic drug in the thiazolidinedione class of drugs. It is marketed by the pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline as a stand-alone drug (Avandia) and in combination with metformin (Avandamet) or with glimepiride (Avandaryl). Like other thiazolidinediones, the mechanism of action of rosiglitazone is by activation of the intracellular receptor class of the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs), specifically PPARγ. Rosiglitazone is a selective ligand of PPARγ, and has no PPARα-binding action. Apart from its effect on insulin resistance, it appears to have an anti-inflammatory effect: nuclear factor kappa-B (NFκB) levels fall and inhibitor (IκB) levels increase in patients on rosiglitazone. Recent research has suggested that rosiglitazone may also be of benefit to a subset of patients with Alzheimer's disease not expressing the ApoE4 allele. This is the subject of a clinical trial currently underway."
DB00413,"Pramipexole is a drug used to treat the symptoms of Parkinson's Disease (PD).  It is a _non-ergot dopamine agonist_ drug that is efficacious in treating various Parkinson's symptoms such as tremor, rigidity, and bradykinesia (slow movement) [A176867]. It was first approved by the FDA in 1997 [L5882]. Parkinson's Disease is one of the most common neurodegenerative disorders and causes a high level of disability in patients [A176855], leading to increased difficulty in performing activities of daily living due to symptoms that progress over time [A176858]. The prevalence of Parkinson's Disease worldwide has increased from approximately 2.5 million in 1990 to about 6.1 million in 2016 [A176861].  This increase may be attributed to an aging population along with other contributing factors [A176861].

In addition to the above FDA approval for Parkinson's Disease, pramipexole was also approved by the FDA in 2006 for the treatment of Restless Legs Syndrome (RLS) [A176873]. RLS is a sleep-related disorder characterized by unpleasant sensations in the lower extremities, often accompanied by an uncontrollable urge to move the legs [A176876]."

It inhibits the enzyme glucosylceramide synthase, an essential enzyme for the synthesis of most glycosphingolipids. It is only used for patients who cannot be treated with enzyme replacement therapy with imiglucerase. Miglustat is now the first and only approved therapy for patients with Niemann-Pick disease type C (NP-C). It has recently been approved for treatment of progressive neurological symptoms in adult and pediatric patients in the European Union, Brazil, and South Korea. Miglustat was first developed as an anti-HIV agent in the 1990s. However, clinical experience with miglustat showed that therapeutic levels of the drug could not be achieved in patients without a high incidence of adverse effect."
DB00421,"Spironolactone is a potassium-sparing diuretic. It binds to mineralocorticoid receptors and functions as aldosterone antagonists.[A178192] It promotes sodium and water excretion and potassium retention.[A11837] Spironolactone was originally developed purely for this ability before other pharmacodynamic properties of the drug were discovered.[A11837, A178246] It is indicated to treat several conditions, including heart failure, edema, hyperaldosteronism, and hypertension.[L44602] Off-label uses of spironolactone include hirsutism, female pattern hair loss, and adult acne vulgaris.[A178135, A261025]

DB00422,"Methylphenidate is a central nervous system stimulant used most commonly in the treatment of Attention-Deficit/Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) and for narcolepsy. Also known as the marketed products Ritalin, Concerta, or Biphentin, methylphenidate is used with other treatment modalities (psychological, educational, cognitive behaviour therapy, etc) to improve the following group of developmentally inappropriate symptoms associated with ADHD: moderate-to-severe distractibility, short attention span, hyperactivity, emotional lability, and impulsivity. Long-acting formulations of psychostimulants such as methylphenidate, [DB01576], and [DB01255] are considered the most effective and widely used treatment for ADHD, and are considered first-line options for children, adolescents, and adults as recommended by CADDRA (Canadian ADHD Resource Alliance). [L6037] CADDRA recommends the use of methylphenidate due to long term studies, of over twenty years in duration, which show methylphenidate is safe and effective.  

While its exact mechanism is unclear, methylphenidate (MPH) has been shown to act as a norepinephrine and dopamine reuptake inhibitor (NDRI), thereby increasing the presence of these neurotransmitters in the extraneuronal space and prolonging their action.[A177541] There is a dose-related effect of psychostimulants on receptor stimulation, where higher doses are shown to increase norepinephrine (NE) and dopamine (DA) efflux throughout the brain which can result in impaired cognition and locomotor-activating effects. In contrast, low doses are found to selectively activate NE and DA neurotransmission within the prefrontal cortex which is an area of the brain thought to play a prominent role in ADHD pathophysiology, thereby improving clinical efficacy and preventing side effects.[A177547] The lower doses used to treat ADHD are not associated with the locomotor-activating effects associated with higher doses and instead reduce movement, impulsivity, and increase cognitive function including sustained attention and working memory.[A177541, A177544] Methylphenidate's beneficial effects in sustaining attention have also been shown to be mediated by alpha-1 adrenergic receptor activity.[A177550] Clinical findings have shown that children with ADHD have an abnormality in the dopamine transporter gene (DAT1), the D4 receptor gene (DRD-4), and/or the D2 receptor gene that may be at least partly overcome by the dopaminergic effects of methylphenidate, suggesting a possible mode of action.[F4474]

When provided as Biphentin®, methylphenidate is released through a multi-layer release delivery system (MLRTM) where 40% of the dose is provided as an immediate release and 60% is provided through a gradual release. Biphentin was designed to be an alternative to separate doses of immediate-release (IR) methylphenidate by providing a biphasic concentration-time profile when given as a single dose. The MLRTM release system allows for a sustained effect for 10-12 hours, allowing for once-daily dosing that covers the major times that ADHD impairment might occur (such as school, homework periods, during the work day, etc).

When provided as Concerta®, methylphenidate is released through the patented Osmotic Controlled-Release Oral Delivery (OROS) system where 22% of the dose is provided as an immediate release and 78% is provided through a gradual release.[A631] OROS is comprised of an osmotically active trilayer core surrounded by a semipermeable membrane with an immediate-release drug overcoat. Within an aqueous environment, such as the stomach, the drug overcoat, which consists of 22% of the dose, dissolves within one hour, providing an initial immediate-release formulation of methylphenidate. Water then permeates through the membrane into the tablet core where the osmotically active polymer excipients expand, allowing methylphenidate to release slowly through the orifice over a period of 6-7 hours. Concerta also provides a sustained 10-12 hour effect, allowing for once-daily dosing.

Methylphenidate contains a blackbox warning stating that CNS stimulants, including methylphenidate-containing products and amphetamines, have a high potential for abuse and dependence. This abuse potential is likely related to the effects associated with higher doses of methylphenidate, which induce surface expression of the dopamine transporter (DAT).[A177553] In particular, increased dopamine in key brain areas is associated with the reinforcing and addictive properties of psychostimulants such as methylphenidate, and even amplifies the potency and reinforcing effects of other drugs of abuse such as amphetamines, making ADHD sufferers more susceptible to their addictive effects.[A177556] Concerns about abuse potential have spurred research into medications with fewer effects on DAT and the use of non-stimulant ADHD medications including [DB00289] and [DB01018]."

DB00451,"Levothyroxine is a synthetically produced form of thyroxine, a major endogenous hormone secreted by the thyroid gland.[F4633] Also known as L-thyroxine or the brand name product Synthroid, levothyroxine is used primarily to treat hypothyroidism, a condition where the thyroid gland is no longer able to produce sufficient quantities of the thyroid hormones T<sub>4</sub> (tetraiodothyronine or thyroxine) and T<sub>3</sub> (triiodothyronine or [DB00279]), resulting in diminished down-stream effects of these hormones. Without sufficient quantities of circulating thyroid hormones, symptoms of hypothyroidism begin to develop such as fatigue, increased heart rate, depression[A179620], dry skin and hair, muscle cramps, constipation, weight gain, memory impairment, and poor tolerance to cold temperatures.[F4636,A35722]

In response to Thyroid Stimulating Hormone (TSH) release by the pituitary gland, a normally functioning thyroid gland will produce and secrete T<sub>4</sub>, which is then converted through deiodination (by type I or type II 5′-deiodinases)[A179941] into its active metabolite T<sub>3</sub>. While T<sub>4</sub> is the major product secreted by the thyroid gland,  T<sub>3</sub> exerts the majority of the physiological effects of the thyroid hormones; T<sub>4</sub> and T<sub>3</sub> have a relative potency of ~1:4 (T4:T3).[F4633] T<sub>4</sub> and T<sub>3</sub> act on nearly every cell of the body, but have a particularly strong effect on the cardiac system.[A179935] As a result, many cardiac functions including heart rate, cardiac output, and systemic vascular resistance are closely linked to thyroid status.[A179938]

Prior to the development of levothyroxine, [DB09100] or desiccated thyroid, used to be the mainstay of treatment for hypothyroidism. However, this is no longer recommended for the majority of patients due to several clinical concerns including limited controlled trials supporting its use. Desiccated thyroid products contain a ratio of T4 to T3 of 4.2:1, which is significantly lower than the 14:1 ratio of secretion by the human thyroid gland. This higher proportion of T3 in desiccated thyroid products can lead to supraphysiologic levels of T3 which may put patients at risk of thyrotoxicosis if thyroid extract therapy is not adjusted according to the serum TSH.[A35722, F4636]"

DB00458,"Imipramine, the prototypical tricyclic antidepressant (TCA), is a dibenzazepine-derivative TCA. TCAs are structurally similar to phenothiazines. They contain a tricyclic ring system with an alkyl amine substituent on the central ring. In non-depressed individuals, imipramine does not affect mood or arousal, but may cause sedation. In depressed individuals, imipramine exerts a positive effect on mood. TCAs are potent inhibitors of serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake. Tertiary amine TCAs, such as imipramine and amitriptyline, are more potent inhibitors of serotonin reuptake than secondary amine TCAs, such as nortriptyline and desipramine. TCAs also block histamine H<sub>1</sub> receptors, &alpha;<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic receptors and muscarinic receptors, which accounts for their sedative, hypotensive and anticholinergic effects (e.g. blurred vision, dry mouth, constipation, urinary retention), respectively [A6584]. Imipramine has less sedative and anticholinergic effects than the tertiary amine TCAs, amitriptyline and clomipramine. Imipramine may be used to treat depression and nocturnal enuresis in children [FDA Label]. Unlabeled indications include chronic and neuropathic pain (including diabetic neuropathy), panic disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD), and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) [L1349,L1348,A31900,L1351,L1352,L1353,A31904]."

It was used commonly and as a bitter and flavoring agent, and is still useful for the treatment of babesiosis. Quinine is also useful in some muscular disorders, especially nocturnal leg cramps and myotonia congenita, because of its direct effects on muscle membrane and sodium channels. The mechanisms of its antimalarial effects are not well understood."
DB00470,"Dronabinol (marketed as Marinol) is a synthetic form of delta-9-tetrahydrocannabinol (Δ⁹-THC), the primary psychoactive component of cannabis (marijuana). THC demonstrates its effects through weak partial agonist activity at Cannabinoid-1 (CB1R) and Cannabinoid-2 (CB2R) receptors, which results in the well-known effects of smoking cannabis such as increased appetite, reduced pain, and changes in emotional and cognitive processes. Due to its evidence as an appetite stimulant and an anti-nauseant, Dronabinol is approved for use in anorexia associated with weight loss in patients with AIDS and for the treatment of nausea and vomiting associated with cancer chemotherapy in patients who have failed to respond adequately to conventional antiemetic treatments [FDA Label].

Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) and cannabidiol (CBD) are the two most abundant cannabinoids found naturally in the resin of the marijuana plant, both of which are pharmacologically active due to their interaction with cannabinoid receptors that are found throughout the body [A32830]. While both CBD and THC are used for medicinal purposes, they have different receptor activity, function, and physiological effects. If not provided in their activated form (such as through synthetic forms like Dronabinol or [DB00486]), THC and CBD are obtained through conversion from their precursors, tetrahydrocannabinolic acid-A (THCA-A) and cannabidiolic acid (CBDA), through decarboxylation reactions. This can be achieved through heating, smoking, vaporization, or baking of dried unfertilized female cannabis flowers.

From a pharmacological perspective, Cannabis' diverse receptor profile explains its potential application for such a wide variety of medical conditions. Cannabis contains more than 400 different chemical compounds, of which 61 are considered cannabinoids, a class of compounds that act upon endogenous cannabinoid receptors of the body [A32584]. The endocannabinoid system is widely distributed throughout the central and peripheral nervous system (via the Cannabinoid Receptors CB1 and CB2) and plays a role in many physiological processes such as inflammation, cardiovascular function, learning, pain, memory, stress and emotional regulation, and the sleep/wake cycle among many others [A32824]. CB1 receptors are found in both the central and peripheral nervous system, and are most abundant in the hippocampus and amygdala, which are the areas of the brain responsible for short-term memory storage and emotional regulation. CB2 receptors are mainly located in the peripheral nervous system and can be found on lymphoid tissue where they are involved in regulation of immune function [A32676]."

DB00481,"Raloxifene is a second generation selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM) that mediates anti-estrogenic effects on breast and uterine tissues, and estrogenic effects on bone, lipid metabolism, and blood coagulation.[A4979,T28] Exhibiting tissue-specific effects distinct from [estradiol], raloxifene is the first of the benzothiophene group of antiestrogens to be labelled a SERM.[A4977] Available in many countries worldwide, raloxifene was initially approved by the FDA in December, 1997 under the market name Evista® for the management and prevention of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women and reduction in risk for invasive breast cancer in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis or those who are at high risk for invasive breast cancer. However, it has a negligible effect on altering the development and progression of breast cancer itself.[label] The most common causes of osteoporosis include postmenopausal deficiency of estrogen and age-related deterioration in bone homeostasis. Due to the risk of bone fractures that may lead to morbidities and reduced quality of life, the management of osteoporosis in postmenopausal women with the use of therapeutic agents in addition to concurrent therapies is critical. Due to the decline in estrogen levels in postmenopausal osteoporosis, hormone replacement therapy (HRT), such as estradiol, has been used to ameliorate the condition. However, due to the off-target actions by HRT, newer non-hormonal agents such as raloxifene and [tamoxifen] have been developed to reduce adverse events through selective pharmacological actions on tissue-specific therapeutic targets.[T28]

The main effects of raloxifene are to preserve the bone mineral density and decrease the risk of breast cancer in postmenopausal women. Compared to estrogen and tamoxifen, raloxifene was not associated with an increased risk of uterine cancer and it does not cause endometrial proliferation.[A716] Although rare, there was an increased risk of venous thromboembolism during clinical trials of postmenopausal women receiving raloxifene. In addition, a clinical study consisting of postmenopausal women with documented coronary heart disease or at increased risk for coronary events showed an increased risk for fatal stroke with raloxifene therapy compared to placebo.[label] It is strongly advised that the risk-benefit ratio is considered before starting raloxifene therapy in women at risk of thromboembolic disease or strokes, such as the prior history of stroke, transient ischemic attack, atrial fibrillation, hypertension, or cigarette smoking.[label]"

DB00484,"Brimonidine is an alpha-adrenergic agonist and 2-imidazoline derivative that was first introduced in 1996.[A178951] It is considered to be a third generation alpha-2 aadrenergic receptor agonist, since it displays preferential binding at alpha-2 adrenoceptors over alpha-1 receptors.[A179002] Brimonidine displays a higher selectivity toward the alpha-2 adrenergic receptors than [clonidine] or [apraclonidine], which are also alpha-2 adrenergic agonists.[A178969] Alpha-2 adrenergic agonists are members of the ocular hypotensive agent drug class that are used in the chronic treatment of glaucoma. Early treatment and management of glaucoma, which predominantly involves the lowering of intraocular pressure, is critical since glaucoma is considered to be a common cause of blindness worldwide.[A178948,A178969] 

Ophthalmically, brimonidine is used to lower intraocular pressure by reducing aqueous humor production and increasing uveoscleral outflow. Because it is oxidately stable, brimonidine is associated with fewer reports of ocular allergic reactions compared to other alpha-2 adrenergic agonists.[A178969] The ophthalmic solution of brimonidine was first approved by the FDA in 1996 as Alphagan [label] and brimonidine is the only selective alpha-adrenergic receptor agonist approved for chronic treatment in glaucoma.[A36674] Brimonidine is also found in ophthalmic solutions in combination with [brinzolamide] under the market name Simbrinza for the reduction in intraocular pressure. Unlike nonselective beta-blockers used in ocular hypertension, brimonidine is not associated with significantly adverse cardiopulmonary side effects.[A178945] Thus brimonidine is an effective and safe alternative to beta-blockers, in patients with, or at high risk for, cardiopulmonary disease.[A178948] The topical form of brimonidine was approved by the FDA in August 2013 for the symptomatic treatment of persistent facial erythema of rosacea in adults.

DB00502,"Haloperidol is a high potency first-generation (typical) antipsychotic and one of the most frequently used antipsychotic medications used worldwide.[A180616] While haloperidol has demonstrated pharmacologic activity at a number of receptors in the brain,[A27477] it exerts its antipsychotic effect through its strong antagonism of the dopamine receptor (mainly D2), particularly within the mesolimbic and mesocortical systems of the brain. Haloperidol is indicated for the treatment of the manifestations of several psychotic disorders including schizophrenia, acute psychosis, Tourette syndrome, and other severe behavioural states.[F4645] It is also used off-label for the management of chorea associated with Huntington's disease and for the treatment of intractable hiccups as it is a potent antiemetic. Dopamine-antagonizing medications such as haloperidol are though to improve psychotic symptoms and states that are caused by an over-production of dopamine, such as schizophrenia, which is theorized to be caused by a hyperdopaminergic state within the limbic system of the brain.[A34360]

Use of the first-generation antipsychotics (including haloperidol) is considered highly effective for the management of the ""positive"" symptoms of schizophrenia including hallucinations, hearing voices, aggression/hostility, disorganized speech, and psychomotor agitation. However, this class of drugs is also limited by the development of movement disorders induced by dopamine-blockade such as drug-induced parkinsonism, akathisia, dystonia, tardive dyskinesia, as well as other side effects including sedation, weight gain, and prolactin changes. While there are limited high-quality studies comparing haloperidol to lower-potency first-generation antipsychotics such as [DB00477], [DB01624], [DB00623], and [DB01403], haloperidol typically demonstrates the least amount of side effects within this class, but demonstrates a stronger disposition for causing extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS).[A180613, A180616, A180625] These other low‐potency antipsychotics are limited by their lower affinity for dopamine receptors, which requires a higher dose to effectively treat symptoms of schizophrenia. In addition, they block many receptors other than the primary target (dopamine receptors), such as cholinergic or histaminergic receptors, resulting in a higher incidence of side effects such as sedation, weight gain, and hypotension.

Interestingly, in vivo pharmacogenetic studies have demonstrated that the metabolism of haloperidol may be modulated by genetically determined polymorphic _CYP2D6_ activity. However, these findings contradict the findings from studies in vitro with human liver microsomes and from drug interaction studies in vivo. Inter-ethnic and pharmacogenetic differences in haloperidol metabolism may possibly explain these observations.[A32346]

First-generation antipsychotic drugs have largely been replaced with second- and third-generation (atypical) antipsychotics such as [DB00734], [DB00334], [DB00363], [DB01224], [DB01238], and [DB00246]. However, haloperidol use remains widespread and is considered the benchmark for comparison in trials of the newer generation antipsychotics.[A180625]

DB00584,"Enalapril is a prodrug belonging to the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor drug class that works on the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, which is responsible for the regulation of blood pressure and fluid and electrolyte homeostasis. Enalapril is an orally-active and long-acting nonsulphydryl antihypertensive agent that suppresses the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system to lower blood pressure. It was developed from a targeted research programmed using molecular modelling.[A18459] Being a prodrug, enalapril is rapidly biotransformed into its active metabolite, [enalaprilat], which is responsible for the pharmacological actions of enalapril. The active metabolite of enalapril competitively inhibits the ACE to hinder the production of angiotensin II, a key component of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system that promotes vasoconstriction and renal reabsorption of sodium ions in the kidneys. Ultimately, enalaprilat works to reduce blood pressure and blood fluid volume.

Commonly marketed under the trade name Vasotec, enalapril was first approved by the FDA in 1985 for the management of hypertension, heart failure, and asymptomatic left ventricular dysfunction. It is also found in a combination product containing [hydrochlorothiazide] that is used for the management of hypertension. The active metabolite enalaprilat is also available in oral tablets and intravenous formulations for injection."

The FDA issued a warning letter regarding this risk to health care professionals and patients."
DB00605,"Sulindac is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) of the arylalkanoic acid class that is marketed by Merck under the brand name Clinoril. Like other NSAIDs, it may be used in the treatment of acute or chronic inflammatory conditions. Sulindac is a prodrug, derived from sulfinylindene, that is converted _in vivo_ to an active sulfide compound by liver enzymes. There is evidence from some studies that sulindac may be associated with fewer gastrointestinal side effects than other NSAIDs, except for the cyclooxygenase-2 (COX-2) inhibitor drug class. This may be due to the sulfide metabolite undergoing enterohepatic circulation thus maintaining constant blood levels of the compound without inducing gastrointestinal effects, where the drug is excreted in the bile and then reabsorbed from the intestines. While its full mechanism of action is not fully understood, sulindac is thought to primarily mediate its action by inhibiting prostaglandin synthesis by inhibiting COX-1 and COX-2."
DB00608,"Chloroquine is an aminoquinolone derivative first developed in the 1940s for the treatment of malaria.[A191655] It was the drug of choice to treat malaria until the development of newer antimalarials such as [pyrimethamine], [artemisinin], and [mefloquine].[A191787] Chloroquine and its derivative [hydroxychloroquine] have since been repurposed for the treatment of a number of other conditions including HIV, systemic lupus erythematosus, and rheumatoid arthritis.[A192432]

It belongs to the statin class of medications, which are used to lower the risk of cardiovascular disease and manage abnormal lipid levels by inhibiting the endogenous production of cholesterol in the liver. More specifically, statin medications competitively inhibit the enzyme hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) Reductase,[A181421] which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonic acid and is the third step in a sequence of metabolic reactions involved in the production of several compounds involved in lipid metabolism and transport including cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (sometimes referred to as ""bad cholesterol""), and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL). Prescribing of statin medications is considered standard practice following any cardiovascular events and for people with a moderate to high risk of development of CVD, such as those with Type 2 Diabetes. The clear evidence of the benefit of statin use coupled with very minimal side effects or long term effects has resulted in this class becoming one of the most widely prescribed medications in North America.[A181087, A181406]

Simvastatin and other drugs from the statin class of medications including [atorvastatin], [pravastatin], [rosuvastatin], [fluvastatin], and [lovastatin] are considered first-line options for the treatment of dyslipidemia.[A181087, A181406] Increasing use of the statin class of drugs is largely due to the fact that cardiovascular disease (CVD), which includes heart attack, atherosclerosis, angina, peripheral artery disease, and stroke, has become a leading cause of death in high-income countries and a major cause of morbidity around the world.[A181084] Elevated cholesterol levels, and in particular, elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, are an important risk factor for the development of CVD.[A181087,A181553] Use of statins to target and reduce LDL levels has been shown in a number of landmark studies to significantly reduce the risk of development of CVD and all-cause mortality.[A181090,A181093,A181096,A181427,A181475,A181538] Statins are considered a cost-effective treatment option for CVD due to their evidence of reducing all-cause mortality including fatal and non-fatal CVD as well as the need for surgical revascularization or angioplasty following a heart attack.[A181087, A181406] Evidence has shown that even for low-risk individuals (with <10% risk of a major vascular event occurring within 5 years) statins cause a 20%-22% relative reduction in major cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke, coronary revascularization, and coronary death) for every 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL without any significant side effects or risks.[A181397, A181403]

While all statin medications are considered equally effective from a clinical standpoint, [rosuvastatin] is considered the most potent; doses of 10 to 40mg [rosuvastatin] per day were found in clinical studies to result in a 45.8% to 54.6% decrease in LDL cholesterol levels, while simvastatin has been found to have an average decrease in LDL-C of ~35%.[A181409,A181535,A181538,A1793] Potency is thought to correlate to tissue permeability as the more lipophilic statins such as simvastatin are thought to enter endothelial cells by passive diffusion, as opposed to hydrophilic statins such as [pravastatin] and [rosuvastatin] which are taken up into hepatocytes through OATP1B1 (organic anion transporter protein 1B1)-mediated transport.[A181424,A181460] Despite these differences in potency, several trials have demonstrated only minimal differences in terms of clinical outcomes between statins.[A181427]"
DB00642,"Pemetrexed is a chemotherapy drug that is manufactured and marketed by Eli Lilly and Company under the brand name Alimta. It is indicated for use in combination with cisplatin for the treatment of patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma whose disease is either unresectable or who are otherwise not candidates for curative surgery. Its use in non-small cell lung cancer has also been investigated. Pemetrexed was first approved by the FDA in February 4, 2004.[A253907]"
DB00644,Gonadorelin is another name for gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). It is a synthetic decapeptide prepared using solid phase peptide synthesis. GnRH is responsible for the release of follicle stimulating hormone and leutinizing hormone from the anterior pituitary.
DB00647,"Dextropropoxyphene is an opioid analgesic manufactured by Eli Lilly and Company. It is used in the symptomatic treatment of mild pain. It displays antitussive and local anaesthetic actions. Due to the risk of cardiac arrhythmias and overdose, possibly leading to death, dextropropoxyphene has been withdrawn from the market in Europe and the United States. The drug is often referred to as the general form, ""propoxyphene"", however only the dextro-isomer (dextropropoxyphene) has any analgesic effect. The levo-isomer appears to exhibit a very limited antitussive effect."
DB00650,"Folinic Acid (also known as 5-formyl tetrahydrofolic acid or leucovorin) is the 5-formyl derivative of tetrahydrofolic acid, a necessary co-factor in the body. Commercially available leucovorin is composed of a 1:1 racemic mixture of the dextrorotary and levorotary isomers, while levoleucovorin contains only the pharmacologically active levo-isomer. In vitro, the levo-isomer has been shown to be rapidly converted to the biologically available methyl-tetrahydrofolate form while the dextro form is slowly excreted by the kidneys. Despite this difference in activity, the two commercially available forms have been shown to be pharmacokinetically identical and may be used interchangeably with limited differences in efficacy or side effects (Kovoor et al, 2009). 

As folate analogs, leucovorin and levoleucovorin are both used to counteract the toxic effects of folic acid antagonists, such as methotrexate, which act by inhibiting the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR). They are indicated for use as rescue therapy following use of high-dose methotrexate in the treatment of osteosarcoma or for diminishing the toxicity associated with inadvertent overdosage of folic acid antagonists. Injectable forms are also indicated for use in the treatment of megaloblastic anemias due to folic acid deficiency when oral therapy is not feasible and for use in combination with 5-fluorouracil to prolong survival in the palliative treatment of patients with advanced colorectal cancer. 

Folic acid is an essential B vitamin required by the body for the synthesis of purines, pyrimidines, and methionine before incorporation into DNA or protein. However, in order to function in this role, it must first be reduced by the enzyme dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) into the cofactors dihydrofolate (DHF) and tetrahydrofolate (THF). This important pathway, which is required for de novo synthesis of nucleic acids and amino acids, is disrupted when high-dose methotrexate is used for cancer therapy. As methotrexate functions as a DHFR inhibitor to prevent DNA synthesis in rapidly dividing cells, it also prevents the formation of DHF and THF. This results in a deficiency of coenzymes and a resultant buildup of toxic substances that are responsible for numerous adverse side effects associated with methotrexate therapy. As levoleucovorin and leucovorin are analogs of tetrahydrofolate (THF), they are able to bypass DHFR reduction and act as a cellular replacement for the co-factor THF, thereby preventing these toxic side effects."

DB00654,"Latanoprost is a prodrug analog of prostaglandin F2 alpha that is used to treat elevated intraocular pressure (IOP). It was initially approved by the FDA in 1998. Latanoprost is the first topical prostaglandin F2 alpha analog used for glaucoma treatment.[A184493] It has been found to be well-tolerated and its use does not normally result in systemic adverse effects like other drugs used to treat elevated intraocular pressure, such as [Timolol]. Another benefit latanoprost is that it can be administered once a day.[A184490]"
DB00655,"Estrone, one of the major mammalian estrogens, is an aromatized C18 steroid with a 3-hydroxyl group and a 17-ketone. It is produced in vivo from androstenedione or from testosterone via estradiol. It is produced primarily in the ovaries, placenta, and in peripheral tissues (especially adipose tissue) through conversion of adrostenedione. Estrone may be further metabolized to 16-alpha-hydroxyestrone, which may be reduced to estriol by estradiol dehydrogenase."
DB00657,"A nicotinic antagonist that is well absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and crosses the blood-brain barrier. Mecamylamine has been used as a ganglionic blocker in treating hypertension, but, like most ganglionic blockers, is more often used now as a research tool."

DB00661,"Verapamil is a phenylalkylamine calcium channel blocker used in the treatment of high blood pressure, heart arrhythmias, and angina,[L8791] and was the first calcium channel antagonist to be introduced into therapy in the early 1960s.[A188514] It is a member of the non-dihydropyridine class of calcium channel blockers, which includes drugs like [diltiazem] and [flunarizine], but is chemically unrelated to other cardioactive medications.[L8791] Verapamil is administered as a racemic mixture containing equal amounts of the S- and R-enantiomer, each of which is pharmacologically distinct - the S-enantiomer carries approximately 20-fold greater potency than the R-enantiomer, but is metabolized at a higher rate.[A188435]"
DB00668,"Epinephrine, also known as _adrenaline_, is a hormone and neurotransmitter and produced by the adrenal glands that can also be used as a drug due to its various important functions. Though it has long been used in the treatment of hypersensitivity reactions, epinephrine in the auto-injector form (EpiPen) has been available since 1987 in the USA. Many new products/biosimilars and dosage routes have been approved under various names over the last several decades [L4355], [L4356], [L4358].  On August 16, 2018, Teva Pharmaceuticals USA gained approval to market its generic epinephrine auto-injector in 0.3 mg and 0.15 mg strengths [L4353]. Dosage delivery routes for epinephrine include intravenous, inhalation, nebulization, intramuscular injection, and subcutaneous injection.

In general, the most common uses of parenteral epinephrine are to relieve respiratory distress due to bronchospasm, to provide rapid relief of hypersensitivity (anaphylactic or anaphylactoid) reactions to drugs, animal serums and other allergens, and to prolong the action of infiltration anesthetics [F2136]. In addition to the above functions, epinephrine is the primary drug administered during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) to reverse cardiac arrest [A37697], [A37699].  It can be used in severe cases of croup [L4824]."

DB00672,"Chlorpropamide is an oral antihyperglycemic agent used for the treatment of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). It belongs to the sulfonylurea class of insulin secretagogues, which act by stimulating β cells of the pancreas to release insulin. Sulfonylureas increase both basal insulin secretion and meal-stimulated insulin release. Medications in this class differ in their dose, rate of absorption, duration of action, route of elimination and binding site on their target pancreatic β cell receptor. Sulfonylureas also increase peripheral glucose utilization, decrease hepatic gluconeogenesis and may increase the number and sensitivity of insulin receptors. Sulfonylureas are associated with weight gain, though less so than insulin. Due to their mechanism of action, sulfonylureas may cause hypoglycemia and require consistent food intake to decrease this risk. The risk of hypoglycemia is increased in elderly, debilitated and malnourished individuals. Chlorpropamide is not recommended for the treatment of NIDDM as it increases blood pressure and the risk of retinopathy (UKPDS-33). Up to 80% of the single oral dose of chlorpropramide is metabolized, likely in the liver; 80-90% of the dose is excreted in urine as unchanged drug and metabolites. Renal and hepatic dysfunction may increase the risk of hypoglycemia."
DB00674,"Galantamine is a tertiary alkaloid and reversible, competitive inhibitor of the acetylcholinesterase (AChE) enzyme, which is a widely studied therapeutic target used in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease.[A1018] First characterized in the early 1950s, galantamine is a tertiary alkaloid that was extracted from botanical sources, such as _Galanthus nivalis_.[A201968] Galantamine was first studied in paralytic and neuropathic conditions, such as myopathies and postpolio paralytic conditions, and for reversal of neuromuscular blockade.[A182993,A201968] Following the discovery of its AChE-inhibiting properties, the cognitive effects of galantamine were studied in a wide variety of psychiatric disorders such as mild cognitive impairment, cognitive impairment in schizophrenia and bipolar disorder, and autism; however, re-development of the drug for Alzheimer’s disease did not commence until the early 1990s due to difficulties in extraction and synthesis.[A201968] Galantamine blocks the breakdown of acetylcholine in the synaptic cleft, thereby increasing acetylcholine neurotransmission. It also acts as an allosteric modulator of the nicotinic receptor, giving its dual mechanism of action clinical significance.[A182993]

The drug was approved by the FDA in 2001 for the treatment of mild to moderate dementia of the Alzheimer's type. As Alzheimer's disease is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, galantamine is not known to alter the course of the underlying dementing process. Galantamine works to block the enzyme responsible for the breakdown of acetylcholine in the synaptic cleft, thereby enhancing cholinergic neuron function and signalling. Under this hypothesized mechanism of action, the therapeutic effects of galantamine may decrease as the disease progression advances and fewer cholinergic neurons remain functionally intact.[L13571] It is therefore not considered to be a disease-modifying drug.[A203558] Galantamine is marketed under the brand name Razadyne, and is available as oral immediate- and extended-release tablets and solution.[L13571]"
DB00675,"Tamoxifen is a non-steroidal antiestrogen used to treat estrogen receptor positive breast cancers as well as prevent the incidence of breast cancer in high risk populations.[A1025,L7799,L7802] Tamoxifen is used alone or as an adjuvant in these treatments.[L7799,L7802] Tamoxifen may no longer be the preferred treatment for these types of cancers as patients generally have better survival, side effect profiles, and compliance with [anastrozole].[A1026]

Tamoxifen was granted FDA approval on 30 December 1977.[L7799]"
DB00678,"Losartan is an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) used to treat hypertension.[L7423] Angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are used for a similar indication but are associated with a cough.[L7423] When patients with ACE inhibitor associated coughs are switched to ARBs like losartan, they have an incidence of cough similar to placebo or [hydrochlorothiazide].[L7423] Losartan is available as losartan potassium oral tablets as well as a combination tablet of losartan potassium and hydrochlorothiazide.[L7423,L7426] Patients taking losartan should have their renal function and potassium levels monitored.[L7423] Losartan was granted FDA approval on 14 April 1995.[L7423]"

Thioridazine was withdrawn worldwide in 2005 due to its association with cardiac arrythmias."
DB00682,"Warfarin is an anticoagulant drug normally used to prevent blood clot formation as well as migration. Although originally marketed as a pesticide (d-Con, Rodex, among others), Warfarin has since become the most frequently prescribed oral anticoagulant in North America. Warfarin has several properties that should be noted when used medicinally, including its ability to cross the placental barrier during pregnancy which can result in fetal bleeding, spontaneous abortion, preterm birth, stillbirth, and neonatal death. Additional adverse effects such as necrosis, purple toe syndrome, osteoporosis, valve and artery calcification, and drug interactions have also been documented with warfarin use. Warfarin does not actually affect blood viscosity, rather, it inhibits vitamin-k dependent synthesis of biologically active forms of various clotting factors in addition to several regulatory factors."

It is an anthranilic acid derivative.[L7958] Furosemide is used for edema secondary to various clinical conditions, such as congestive heart failure exacerbation, liver failure, renal failure, and high blood pressure.[L7961] It mainly works by inhibiting electrolyte reabsorption from the kidneys and enhancing the excretion of water from the body. Furosemide has a fast onset and short duration of action and has been used safely and effectively in both pediatric and adult patients.[A182495] The use of furosemide is particularly beneficial in clinical settings that require a drug with a higher diuretic potential. In addition to oral formulations, the solution for intravenous and intramuscular administration is also available, which is typically limited to patients who are unable to take oral medication or for patients in emergency clinical situations.[L7958]"

DB00731,"Nateglinide is an oral antihyperglycemic agent used for the treatment of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). It belongs to the meglitinide class of short-acting insulin secretagogues, which act by binding to β cells of the pancreas to stimulate insulin release. Nateglinide is an amino acid derivative that induces an early insulin response to meals decreasing postprandial blood glucose levels. It should only be taken with meals and meal-time doses should be skipped with any skipped meal. Approximately one month of therapy is required before a decrease in fasting blood glucose is seen. Meglitnides may have a neutral effect on weight or cause a slight increase in weight. The average weight gain caused by meglitinides appears to be lower than that caused by sulfonylureas and insulin and appears to occur only in those naïve to oral antidiabetic agents. Due to their mechanism of action, meglitinides may cause hypoglycemia although the risk is thought to be lower than that of sulfonylureas since their action is dependent on the presence of glucose. In addition to reducing postprandial and fasting blood glucose, meglitnides have been shown to decrease glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels, which are reflective of the last 8-10 weeks of glucose control. Meglitinides appear to be more effective at lowering postprandial blood glucose than metformin, sulfonylureas and thiazolidinediones. Nateglinide is extensively metabolized in the liver and excreted in urine (83%) and feces (10%). The major metabolites possess less activity than the parent compound. One minor metabolite, the isoprene, has the same potency as its parent compound."

Organophosphates bind to the esteratic site of acetylcholinesterase, which results initially in reversible inactivation of the enzyme. If given within 24 hours,after organophosphate exposure, pralidoxime reactivates the enzyme cholinesterase by cleaving the phosphate-ester bond formed between the organophosphate and acetylcholinesterase."
DB00734,"Risperidone is a second-generation antipsychotic (SGA) medication used in the treatment of a number of mood and mental health conditions including schizophrenia and bipolar disorder.[L12885] It is one of the most widely used SGAs. [Paliperidone], another commonly used SGA, is the primary active metabolite of risperidone (i.e. 9-hydroxyrisperidone).[L12885]

Schizophrenia and various mood disorders are thought to be caused by an excess of dopaminergic D2 and serotonergic 5-HT2A activity, resulting in overactivity of central mesolimbic pathways and mesocortical pathways, respectively. Risperidone is thought to reduce this overactivity through inhibition of dopaminergic D2 receptors and serotonergic 5-HT2A receptors in the brain.[L12885]

Risperidone binds with a very high affinity to 5-HT2A receptors, approximately 10-20 fold greater than the drug's binding affinity to D2 receptors, and carries lesser activity at several off-targets which may responsible for some of its undesirable effects.[L12885]"
DB00736,"Esomeprazole, sold under the brand name Nexium, is a proton pump inhibitor (PPI) medication used for the management of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), for gastric protection to prevent recurrence of stomach ulcers or gastric damage from chronic use of NSAIDs, and for the treatment of pathological hypersecretory conditions including Zollinger-Ellison (ZE) Syndrome. It can also be found in quadruple regimens for the treatment of _H. pylori_ infections along with other antibiotics including [DB01060], [DB01211], and [DB00916], for example.[A177271, F4498] Its efficacy is considered similar to other medications within the PPI class including [DB00338], [DB00213], [DB00448], [DB05351], and [DB01129]. Esomeprazole is the s-isomer of [DB00338], which is a racemate of the S- and R-enantiomer. Esomeprazole has been shown to inhibit acid secretion to a similar extent as [DB00338], without any significant differences between the two compounds _in vitro_. 

Esomeprazole exerts its stomach acid-suppressing effects by preventing the final step in gastric acid production by covalently binding to sulfhydryl groups of cysteines found on the (H+, K+)-ATPase enzyme at the secretory surface of gastric parietal cells. This effect leads to inhibition of both basal and stimulated gastric acid secretion, irrespective of the stimulus. As the binding of esomeprazole to the (H+, K+)-ATPase enzyme is irreversible and new enzyme needs to be expressed in order to resume acid secretion, esomeprazole's duration of antisecretory effect persists longer than 24 hours.[FDA Label]

PPIs such as esomeprazole have also been shown to inhibit the activity of dimethylarginine dimethylaminohydrolase (DDAH), an enzyme necessary for cardiovascular health. DDAH inhibition causes a consequent accumulation of the nitric oxide synthase inhibitor asymmetric dimethylarginie (ADMA), which is thought to cause the association of PPIs with increased risk of cardiovascular events in patients with unstable coronary syndromes.[A177577, A177580]

Due to their good safety profile and as several PPIs are available over the counter without a prescription, their current use in North America is widespread. Long term use of PPIs such as esomeprazole has been associated with possible adverse effects, however, including increased susceptibility to bacterial infections (including gastrointestinal _C. difficile_), reduced absorption of micronutrients such as iron and B12, and an increased risk of developing hypomagnesemia and hypocalcemia which may contribute to osteoporosis and bone fractures later in life.[A177571]

Rapid discontinuation of PPIs such as esomeprazole may cause a rebound effect and a short term increase in hypersecretion.[A177574] Esomeprazole doses should be slowly lowered, or tapered, before discontinuing to prevent this rebound effect."
DB00741,"Hydrocortisone, or cortisol, is a glucocorticoid secreted by the adrenal cortex.[A188387] Hydrocortisone is used to treat immune, inflammatory, and neoplastic conditions.[L10529,L10532,L10535,L10538,L7772,L7321] It was discovered in the 1930s by Edward Kendall and named Compound F, or 17-hydroxycorticosterone.[A188420]

Hydrocortisone was granted FDA approval on 5 August 1952.[L10574]"
DB00744,"Leukotrienes are substances that induce numerous biological effects including augmentation of neutrophil and eosinophil migration, neutrophil and monocyte aggregation, leukocyte adhesion, increased capillary permeability, and smooth muscle contraction. These effects contribute to inflammation, edema, mucus secretion, and bronchoconstriction in the airways of asthmatic patients. Zileuton relieves such symptoms through its selective inhibition of 5-lipoxygenase, the enzyme that catalyzes the formation of leukotrienes from arachidonic acid. Specifically, it inhibits leukotriene LTB4, LTC4, LTD4, and LTE4 formation. Both the R(+) and S(-) enantiomers are pharmacologically active as 5-lipoxygenase inhibitors in in vitro systems. The immediate release tablet of Zileuton has been withdrawn from the US market."
DB00745,"Modafinil is a stimulant drug marketed as a 'wakefulness promoting agent' and is one of the stimulants used in the treatment of narcolepsy. Narcolepsy is caused by dysfunction of a family of wakefulness-promoting and sleep-suppressing peptides, the orexins, whose neurons are activated by modafinil. The prexin neuron activation is associated with psychoactivation and euphoria. The exact mechanism of action is unclear, although in vitro studies have shown it to inhibit the reuptake of dopamine by binding to the dopamine reuptake pump, and lead to an increase in extracellular dopamine. Modafinil activates glutamatergic circuits while inhibiting GABA."
DB00747,"Scopolamine is a tropane alkaloid isolated from members of the _Solanaceae_ family of plants, similar to [atropine] and [hyoscyamine], all of which structurally mimic the natural neurotransmitter [acetylcholine].[A228423, A228763] Scopolamine was first synthesized in 1959, but to date, synthesis remains less efficient than extracting scopolamine from plants.[A228763] As an acetylcholine analogue, scopolamine can antagonize muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (mAChRs) in the central nervous system and throughout the body, inducing several therapeutic and adverse effects related to alteration of parasympathetic nervous system and cholinergic signalling.[A228758, L31578] Due to its dose-dependent adverse effects, scopolamine was the first drug to be offered commercially as a transdermal delivery system, Scopoderm TTS®, in 1981.[A228423, A228758] As a result of its anticholinergic effects, scopolamine is being investigated for diverse therapeutic applications; currently, it is approved for the prevention of nausea and vomiting associated with motion sickness and surgical procedures.[A228773, L31578]

Scopolamine was first approved by the FDA on December 31, 1979, and is currently available as both oral tablets and a transdermal delivery system.[L31578]"
DB00749,"Etodolac is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antipyretic properties.

DB00754,"Ethotoin is a hydantoin derivative and anticonvulsant. Ethotoin exerts an antiepileptic effect without causing general central nervous system depression. The mechanism of action is probably very similar to that of phenytoin. The latter drug appears to stabilize rather than to raise the normal seizure threshold, and to prevent the spread of seizure activity rather than to abolish the primary focus of seizure discharges. Ethotoin is no longer  commonly used."
DB00755,"Tretinoin, also known as all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA), is a naturally occurring derivative of [vitamin A] (retinol).[A257474] It is an oxidation product in the physiological pathway of vitamin A metabolism.[A257689] In human circulation, tretinoin is normally found at very low concentrations, approximately 4 to 14 nmol/L.[A257689] Tretinoin exhibits anti-inflammatory, antineoplastic, antioxidant, and free radical-scavenging activities.[A257689] It has been used in dermatology for many years to treat various skin conditions ranging from acne to wrinkles [A257474,A258185] and activates nuclear receptors to regulate epithelial cell growth and differentiation.[A257474,A257629,A257609] Tretinoin is given orally to treat acute promyelocytic leukemia [L45349] and topically to treat skin conditions such as acne.[L45389,L34869,L45384]"

DB00759,"Tetracycline is a broad spectrum polyketide antibiotic produced by the Streptomyces genus of Actinobacteria. It exerts a bacteriostatic effect on bacteria by binding reversible to the bacterial 30S ribosomal subunit and blocking incoming aminoacyl tRNA from binding to the ribosome acceptor site. It also binds to some extent to the bacterial 50S ribosomal subunit and may alter the cytoplasmic membrane causing intracellular components to leak from bacterial cells.

The FDA withdrew its approval for the use of all liquid oral drug products formulated for pediatric use containing tetracycline in a concentration greater than 25 mg/ml.[L43942] Other formulations of tetracycline continue to be used."
DB00762,"Irinotecan is an antineoplastic enzyme inhibitor primarily used in the treatment of colorectal cancer. It is a derivative of camptothecin that inhibits the action of topoisomerase I. Irinotecan prevents religation of the DNA strand by binding to topoisomerase I-DNA complex, and causes double-strand DNA breakage and cell death. It is a derivative of camptothecin. Irinotecan was approved for the treatment of advanced pancreatic cancer in October, 2015 (irinotecan liposome injection, trade name Onivyde)."
DB00763,"Methimazole is a thionamide antithyroid agent that inhibits the synthesis of thyroid hormones.[A184559,A184733,A184694] It was first introduced as an antithyroid agent in 1949[A184502] and is now commonly used in the management of hyperthyroidism, particularly in those for whom more aggressive options such as surgery or radioactive iodine therapy are inappropriate.[L8336,L8339]

On a weight basis, methimazole is 10 times more potent than the other major antithyroid thionamide used in North America, [propylthiouracil],[L8339] and is the active metabolite of the pro-drug [carbimazole], which is an antithyroid medication used in the United Kingdom and parts of the former British Commonwealth.[A184733] Traditionally, methimazole has been preferentially used over propylthiouracil due to the risk of fulminant hepatotoxicity carried by the latter,[A184757] with propylthiouracil being preferred in pregnancy due to a perceived lower risk of teratogenic effects. Despite documented teratogenic effects in its published labels,[L8336,L8339] the true teratogenicity of methimazole appears to be unclear[A184643,A184757,A184763] and its place in therapy may change in the future."

DB00773,"A semisynthetic derivative of podophyllotoxin that exhibits antitumor activity. Etoposide inhibits DNA synthesis by forming a complex with topoisomerase II and DNA. This complex induces breaks in double stranded DNA and prevents repair by topoisomerase II binding. Accumulated breaks in DNA prevent entry into the mitotic phase of cell division, and lead to cell death. Etoposide acts primarily in the G2 and S phases of the cell cycle."
DB00775,"Tirofiban prevents the blood from clotting during episodes of chest pain or a heart attack, or while the patient is undergoing a procedure to treat a blocked coronary artery.

DB00776,"Oxcarbazepine is an anti-epileptic medication used in the treatment of partial onset seizures that was first approved for use in the United States in 2000.[L8627,L8630,L8633] It is a structural derivative of [carbamazepine][A186101] and exerts a majority of its activity via a pharmacologically active metabolite, MHD, which exists as a racemate in the blood - a pro-drug of the more active (S)-enantiomer is also marketed as a separate anti-epileptic under the name [eslicarbazepine].[A186011] Compared to other anti-epileptic drugs, which are generally metabolized via the cytochrome P450 system, oxcarbazepine has a reduced propensity for involvement in drug-drug interactions owing to its primarily reductive metabolism.[A186032]"
DB00783,"Estradiol is a naturally occurring hormone circulating endogenously in females. It is commercially available in several hormone therapy products for managing conditions associated with reduced estrogen, such as vulvovaginal atrophy and hot flashes. Some available forms of estradiol include oral tablets, injections, vaginal rings, transdermal patches, sprays, gels, and creams.[L11485,L11488,L11491, L11494,L11497,L11500,L11503] 

When used for oral or IM administration, estradiol is commonly synthesized as a pro-drug ester (such as [DB13952], [DB13953], [DB13954], [DB13955], and [DB13956]). Because it has a low oral bioavailability on its own, estradiol is commonly formulated with an ester side-chain. [DB00977] (EE) is a synthetic form of estradiol commonly used as the estrogenic component of most combination oral contraceptive pills (OCPs). Ethinyl estradiol is different from estradiol due to its higher biovailability and increased resistance to metabolism, rendering it more suitable for oral administration."
DB00787,"Acyclovir is a nucleotide analog antiviral used to treat herpes simplex, _Varicella zoster_, herpes zoster, herpes labialis, and acute herpetic keratitis[L7303,L7315,L7318,L7321,L7324,L7327].

DB00790,"Perindopril is a nonsulfhydryl prodrug that belongs to the angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor class of medications. It is rapidly metabolized in the liver to perindoprilat, its active metabolite, following oral administration. Perindoprilat is a potent, competitive inhibitor of ACE, the enzyme responsible for the conversion of angiotensin I (ATI) to angiotensin II (ATII). ATII regulates blood pressure and is a key component of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS). Perindopril may be used to treat mild to moderate essential hypertension, mild to moderate congestive heart failure, and to reduce the cardiovascular risk of individuals with hypertension or post-myocardial infarction and stable coronary disease."
DB00794,"Primidone is an anticonvulsant used to treat essential tremor as well as grand mal, psychomotor, and focal epileptic seizures.[L11112] Primidone was developed by J Yule Bogue and H C Carrington in 1949.[A189522]

Primidone was granted FDA Approval on 8 March 1954.[L11112]"
DB00795,"Sulfasalazine is an anti-inflammatory drug structurally related to salicylates and other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs. It is indicated for managing inflammatory diseases such as ulcerative colitis and rheumatoid arthritis (RA).[L39065, A255582] Metabolized by intestinal bacteria, sulfasalazine is broken down into [mesalazine] and [sulfapyridine], 2 compounds that carry out the main pharmacological activity of sulfasalazine.[A255582] 

Sulfasalazine was first used in 1940 for rheumatic polyarthritis, and has been firmly established itself as one fo the most useful disease-modifying antirheumatic drug (DMARD).[A255582] Compared to the first line treatment of RA like methotrexate, sulfasalazine is almost as efficacious as methotrexate although with slightly less tolerability. However, sulfasalazine has less teratogenic side effects and faster onset of action compared to conventional DMARD.[A255582] Sulfasalazine fell out of favor as the drug of choice for RA due to poorly designed clinical trials in 1950 but regained interest from the clinical community in the late 1970.[A255582]

Although sulfasalazine is only approved by the FDA for ulcerative colitis, research have shown that sulfasalazine is also beneficial for patients with Crohn's disease.[A255592] Meta-analysis of 19 randomized controlled trials indicated that sulfasalazine is superior to placebo in inducing remission; however, with no supported evidence of mucosal healing, sulfasalazine is not FDA-recommmended for treatment of Crohn's disease.[A255597,A255602,A255607]"
DB00796,"Candesartan is an angiotensin-receptor blocker (ARB) that may be used alone or with other agents to treat hypertension. It is administered orally as the prodrug, candesartan cilexetil, which is rapidly converted to its active metabolite, candesartan, during absorption in the gastrointestinal tract. Candesartan lowers blood pressure by antagonizing the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system (RAAS); it competes with angiotensin II for binding to the type-1 angiotensin II receptor (AT1) subtype and prevents the blood pressure increasing effects of angiotensin II. Unlike angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors, ARBs do not have the adverse effect of dry cough. Candesartan may be used to treat hypertension, isolated systolic hypertension, left ventricular hypertrophy and diabetic nephropathy. It may also be used as an alternative agent for the treatment of heart failure, systolic dysfunction, myocardial infarction and coronary artery disease."
DB00800,A dopamine D1 receptor agonist that is used as an antihypertensive agent. It lowers blood pressure through arteriolar vasodilation.
DB00804,"Dicyclomine is a muscarinic M1, M3, and M2 receptor antagonist as well as a non-competitive inhibitor of histamine and bradykinin used to treat spasms of the intestines seen in functional bowel disorder and irritable bowel syndrome.[A6556,A182555,A234659,L7967] Though it is commonly prescribed, its recommendation may have been based on a small amount of evidence and so its prescription is becoming less favourable.[L7982]

Dicyclomine was granted FDA approval on 11 May 1950.[L7967]"
DB00806,"Pentoxifylline (PTX) is a synthetic dimethylxanthine derivative that modulates the rheological properties of blood and also has both anti-oxidant and anti-inflammatory properties.[A226415, L30300] Although originally developed to treat intermittent claudication, a form of exertion-induced leg pain common in patients with peripheral arterial disease, PTX has been investigated for its possible use in diverse conditions, including osteoradionecrosis, diabetic kidney disease, and generally any condition associated with fibrosis.[A226410, A226415, A226455] More recently, PTX has been suggested as a possible treatment for COVID-19-induced pulmonary complications due to its ability to regulate the production of inflammatory cytokines.[A226608]

Pentoxifylline has been marketed in Europe since 1972; PTX extended-release tablets sold under the trade name TRENTAL by US Pharm Holdings were first approved by the FDA on Aug 30, 1984, but have since been discontinued. A branded product, PENTOXIL, marketed by Upsher-Smith Laboratories, and generic forms marketed by Valeant Pharmaceuticals and APOTEX have been available since the late 1990s.[L30300]"
DB00808,"The most significant modifiable risk factor for cardiovascular disease and the most prominent contributor to all-cause mortality is hypertension.[A204155] Characterized by an office blood pressure of ≥140/90, hypertension is pervasive and impacts an estimated 25% of adults globally.[A204155] Treatment for hypertension should include a number of lifestyle changes (ie. reduced sodium intake) along with pharmacotherapy - it should be noted that treatment with several antihypertensive agents may be required in order to achieve blood pressure targets.[A204155]

Thiazide-like diuretics such as indapamide are a valuable tool for the treatment of hypertension and continue to grow in popularity, falling behind only ACE inhibitors in terms of prescription frequency.[A204134] When compared to [hydrochlorothiazide] (another commonly prescribed diuretic), indapamide has been shown to be superior at lowering systolic blood pressure, reducing left ventricular mass index, lowering oxidative stress, inhibiting platelet aggregation, and reducing microalbuminuria associated with diabetes.[A204134] Interestingly, unlike thiazide diuretics, several sources suggest that indapamide is not associated with glucose or lipid disturbances.[A204134,A204161] 

Indapamide is characterized by both a methylindoline and a sulfamoyl chlorobenzamide functional group, with the former being largely responsible for the molecule’s lipid solubility.[A204158]"
DB00810,"A muscarinic antagonist that has effects in both the central and peripheral nervous systems.

It is sometimes useful also as an adjunct in the treatment of tonic-clonic, myoclonic, and atonic seizures, particularly in women whose seizures occur or are exacerbated at specific times in the menstrual cycle. However, its usefulness is transient often because of rapid development of tolerance. Its antiepileptic effect may be due to its inhibitory effect on brain carbonic anhydrase, which leads to an increased transneuronal chloride gradient, increased chloride current, and increased inhibition.

DB00820,"Tadalafil is a selective phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitor that is used in the treatment of erectile dysfunction (ED), pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), and benign prostatic hypertrophy.[L39100, L39105] It was first approved in 2003 by the FDA for use in ED and later in 2009 for PAH. In contrast to other PDE5 inhibitors like [sildenafil], tadalafil has greater selectivity for PDE5 and a longer half-life which has made it a more suitable option for chronic once-daily dosing in the treatment of PAH.[A242287]"
DB00822,"A carbamate derivative used as an alcohol deterrent. It is a relatively nontoxic substance when administered alone, but markedly alters the intermediary metabolism of alcohol.

DB00861,"Diflunisal, a salicylate derivative, is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent (NSAIA) with pharmacologic actions similar to other prototypical NSAIAs. Diflunisal possesses anti-inflammatory, analgesic and antipyretic activity. Though its mechanism of action has not been clearly established, most of its actions appear to be associated with inhibition of prostaglandin synthesis via the arachidonic acid pathway. Diflunisal is used to relieve pain accompanied with inflammation and in the symptomatic treatment of rheumatoid arthritis and osteoarthritis."
DB00863,"Ranitidine is a commonly used drug, classified as a histamine H2-receptor antagonist, and belongs to the same drug class as [cimetidine] and [famotidine]. This drug helps to prevent and treat gastric-acid associated conditions, including ulcers, because of its ability to decrease gastric acid secretion.[A176759,L10818] Ranitidine is often referred to as Zantac, and is available in various forms, including tablet, injection, and effervescent tablet preparations.[L10818,F4253]

The prevalence of GERD is thought to be 10-20% in western countries.[A176843] Ranitidine has proven to be an effective treatment for relieving uncomfortable symptoms of gastric acid associated conditions and is therefore widely used in GERD and other gastric-acid related conditions.[A176849,L10818]"
DB00864,"Tacrolimus (also FK-506 or Fujimycin) is an immunosuppressive drug whose main use is after organ transplant to reduce the activity of the patient's immune system and so the risk of organ rejection. It is also used in a topical preparation in the treatment of severe atopic dermatitis, severe refractory uveitis after bone marrow transplants, and the skin condition vitiligo. It was discovered in 1984 from the fermentation broth of a Japanese soil sample that contained the bacteria Streptomyces tsukubaensis. Tacrolimus is chemically known as a macrolide. It reduces peptidyl-prolyl isomerase activity by binding to the immunophilin FKBP-12 (FK506 binding protein) creating a new complex. This FKBP12-FK506 complex inhibits calcineurin which inhibits T-lymphocyte signal transduction and IL-2 transcription."

Having been developed in the 1980s by GlaxoSmithKline and approved by the US FDA since January 1991, ondansetron has demonstrated a long history of use and efficacy. Commonly formulated as oral tablets, orally disintegrating tablets (ODT), and injections, and available as generic products as well, ondansetron continues to see contemporary innovations in its formulation and use, including the development of orally soluble films that are both discreet in administration and less of a burden in comparison to having patients attempt to swallow pills during emesis.[L5221]

The FDA withdrew its approval for the use of all intravenous drug products containing more than 16 mg of ondansetron hydrochloride in a single dose, due to a high risk of QT prolongation.[L44067,L43942]"

It is a local anesthetic and vasoconstrictor and is clinically used for that purpose, particularly in the eye, ear, nose, and throat. It also has powerful central nervous system effects similar to the amphetamines and is a drug of abuse. Cocaine, like amphetamines, acts by multiple mechanisms on brain catecholaminergic neurons; the mechanism of its reinforcing effects is thought to involve inhibition of dopamine uptake."
DB00908,"Quinidine is a D-isomer of [quinine] present in the bark of the Cinchona tree and similar plant species. This alkaloid was first described in 1848 and has a long history as an antiarrhythmic medication.[A38016,A250050] Quinidine is considered the first antiarrhythmic drug (class Ia) and is moderately efficacious in the acute conversion of atrial fibrillation to normal sinus rhythm.[A38016] It prolongs cellular action potential by blocking sodium and potassium currents. A phenomenon known as “quinidine syncope” was first described in the 1950s, characterized by syncopal attacks and ventricular fibrillation in patients treated with this drug.[A38016] Due to its side effects and increased risk of mortality, the use of quinidine was reduced over the next few decades. However, it continues to be used in the treatment of Brugada syndrome, short QT syndrome and idiopathic ventricular fibrillation.[A250050]"
DB00909,"Zonisamide is a sulfonamide anticonvulsant used as an adjunctive therapy in adults with partial-onset seizures.[L42530,L42535]  Zonisamide may act by blocking repetitive firing of voltage-gated sodium channels, leading to a reduction of T-type calcium channel currents or by binding allosterically to GABA receptors. This latter action may inhibit the uptake of the inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA while enhancing the uptake of the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate.[L42530,L42535] Zonisamide represents an alternative for patients that remain refractory to established antiepileptic drugs. In 1989, it was approved for commercial use in Japan. The US and Europe approved it in 2000 and 2005, respectively.[A1379,A1383]"
DB00912,"Repaglinide is an oral antihyperglycemic agent used for the treatment of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). It belongs to the meglitinide class of short-acting insulin secretagogues, which act by binding to β cells of the pancreas to stimulate insulin release. Repaglinide induces an early insulin response to meals decreasing postprandial blood glucose levels. It should only be taken with meals and meal-time doses should be skipped with any skipped meal. Approximately one month of therapy is required before a decrease in fasting blood glucose is seen. Meglitnides may have a neutral effect on weight or cause a slight increase in weight. The average weight gain caused by meglitinides appears to be lower than that caused by sulfonylureas and insulin and appears to occur only in those naïve to oral antidiabetic agents. Due to their mechanism of action, meglitinides may cause hypoglycemia although the risk is thought to be lower than that of sulfonylureas since their action is dependent on the presence of glucose. In addition to reducing postprandial and fasting blood glucose, meglitnides have been shown to decrease glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels, which are reflective of the last 8-10 weeks of glucose control. Meglitinides appear to be more effective at lowering postprandial blood glucose than metformin, sulfonylureas and thiazolidinediones. Repaglinide is extensively metabolized in the liver and excreted in bile. Repaglinide metabolites do not possess appreciable hypoglycemic activity. Approximately 90% of a single orally administered dose is eliminated in feces and 8% in urine."
DB00915,"An antiviral that is used in the prophylactic or symptomatic treatment of influenza A. It is also used as an antiparkinsonian agent, to treat extrapyramidal reactions, and for postherpetic neuralgia. The mechanisms of its effects in movement disorders are not well understood but probably reflect an increase in synthesis and release of dopamine, with perhaps some inhibition of dopamine uptake."
DB00917,"Dinoprostone is a naturally occurring prostaglandin E2 (PGE2). It has important effects in labour. It also stimulates osteoblasts to release factors which stimualtes bone resorption by osteoclasts. As a prescription drug it is used as a vaginal suppository, to prepare the cervix for labour and to induce labour."
DB00918,"Almotriptan is a triptan drug for the treatment of migraine headaches. Almotriptan is in a class of medications called selective serotonin receptor agonists. It works by narrowing blood vessels in the brain, stopping pain signals from being sent to the brain, and stopping the release of certain natural substances that cause pain, nausea, and other symptoms of migraine. Almotriptan does not prevent migraine attacks."
DB00921,"Buprenorphine is a weak partial mu-opioid receptor agonist and a weak kappa-opioid receptor antagonist used for the treatment of severe pain.[A186283,A186292] It is also commonly used as an alternative to [methadone] for the treatment of severe opioid addiction.[L46571] Buprenorphine is commercially available as the brand name product Suboxone which is formulated in a 4:1 fixed-dose combination product along with [naloxone], a non-selective competitive opioid receptor antagonist. Combination with naloxone is intended to reduce the abuse potential of Suboxone, as naloxone is poorly absorbed by the oral route (and has no effect when taken orally), but would reverse the opioid agonist effects of buprenorphine if injected intravenously.[A186289,L46571] Buprenorphine has poor gastrointestinal absorption and is therefore formulated as a sublingual tablet.

Buprenorphine has a number of unique pharmacokinetic and pharmacodynamic properties that make it a preferred agent for the treatment of conditions requiring high doses of strong opioids.[A186286] For example, buprenorphine dissociates from opioid receptors very slowly, resulting in a long duration of action and relief from pain or withdrawal symptoms for upwards of 24-36 hours. Use of once-daily buprenorphine may benefit individuals who have developed tolerance to other potent opioids and who require larger and more frequent doses. Buprenorphine may also be a preferred agent over [methadone] (which is also commonly used to treat severe pain and opioid use disorder), as it has less effect on Qtc interval prolongation,[A186271,A186274] fewer drug interactions, reduced risk of sexual side effects,[A186298] and an improved safety profile with a lower risk of overdose and respiratory depression.[A186263,A186266,A186269]

Buprenorphine acts as a partial mu-opioid receptor agonist with a high affinity for the receptor, but lower intrinsic activity compared to other full mu-opioid agonists such as [heroin], [oxycodone], or [methadone].[A186292] This means that buprenorphine preferentially binds the opioid receptor and displaces lower affinity opioids without activating the receptor to a comparable degree. Clinically, this results in a slow onset of action and a clinical phenomenon known as the ""ceiling effect"" where once a certain dose is reached, buprenorphine's effects plateau. This effect can be beneficial, however, as dose-related side effects such as respiratory depression, sedation, and intoxication also plateau at around 32mg, resulting in a lower risk of overdose compared to [methadone] and other full agonist opioids.[A186215,A186218] It also means that opioid-dependent patients do not experience sedation or euphoria at the same rate that they might experience with more potent opioids, improving quality of life for patients with severe pain and reducing the reinforcing effects of opioids which can lead to drug-seeking behaviours.[A186280]

Treatment of opioid addiction with buprenorphine, [methadone], or slow-release oral [morphine] (SROM) is termed Opioid Agonist Treatment (OAT) or Opioid Substitution Therapy (OST). The intention of substitution of illicit opioids with the long-acting opioids used in OAT is to prevent withdrawal symptomns for 24-36 hours following dosing to ultimately reduce cravings and drug-seeking behaviours. Use of OAT is also intended to improved social stabilization including a reduction in crime rates, marginalization, incarceration, and use of illicit substances such as [heroin] or [fentanyl]. Illegally purchased opioids can often be injected and may be laced with other substances that increase the risk of harm or overdose. Provision of OAT is often combined with education about harm reduction including use of clean needles and injection supplies in an effort to reduce the risks associated with injection drug use which includes contraction of HIV and Hepatitis C and other complications including skin infections, abscesses, or endocarditis.[A186295]"
DB00924,"Cyclobenzaprine, a centrally-acting muscle relaxant, was first synthesized in 1961[A185039] and has been available for human use since 1977.[A184982] It was initially studied for use as antidepressant given its structural similarity to tricyclic antidepressants - it differs from [Amitriptyline] by only a single double bond.[A185039,A184982] Since its approval, it has remained relatively popular as an adjunctive, short-term treatment for acute skeletal muscle spasms secondary to musculoskeletal injury."
DB00925,An alpha-adrenergic antagonist with long duration of action. It has been used to treat hypertension and as a peripheral vasodilator.
DB00927,"Famotidine is a competitive histamine-2 (H<sub>2</sub>) receptor antagonist that works to inhibit gastric acid secretion. It is commonly used in gastrointestinal conditions related to acid secretion, such as gastric ulcers and gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), in adults and children.[L11166] Compared to other H<sub>2</sub> receptor antagonists, famotidine displays high selectivity towards this receptor; in a study consisting of healthy volunteers and patients with acid hypersecretory disease, famotidine was about 20 to 50 times more potent at inhibiting gastric acid secretion than [cimetidine] and eight times more potent than [ranitidine] on a weight basis.[A189462] Famotidine is used in various over-the-counter and off-label uses.[L11166] While oral formulations of famotidine are more commonly used, the intravenous solution of the drug is available for use in hospital settings.[L11142]"
DB00928,"Azacitidine is a pyrimidine nucleoside analogue with anti-neoplastic activity. It differs from cytosine by the presence of nitrogen in the C5-position, key in its hypomethylating activity.[A1406,A1413,A1415] Two main mechanisms of action have been proposed for azacitidine. One of them is the induction of cytotoxicity. As an analogue of cytidine, it is able to incorporate into RNA and DNA, disrupting RNA metabolism and inhibiting protein and DNA synthesis. The other one is through the inhibition of DNA methyltransferase, impairing DNA methylation.[A1407] Due to its anti-neoplastic activity and its ability to inhibit methylation in replicating DNA, azacytidine has been used mainly used in the treatment of myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) and acute myeloid leukemia (AML), two types of cancer characterized by the presence of aberrant DNA methylation.[A1407,A1410,A1411,A1416,A1417]

In May 2004, the FDA approved the use of azacitidine administered subcutaneously for the treatment of MDS of all French-American-British (FAB) subtypes. In January 2007, the FDA approved the intravenous administration of azacitidine.[A1415] The use of oral azacitidine for the treatment of AML in patients in complete remission was approved by the FDA in September 2020.[L35335]"

Generally, angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) such as telmisartan bind to the angiotensin II type 1 (AT1) receptors with high affinity, causing inhibition of the action of angiotensin II on vascular smooth muscle, ultimately leading to a reduction in arterial blood pressure.[A1489,A1490] Recent studies suggest that telmisartan may also have PPAR-gamma agonistic properties that could potentially confer beneficial metabolic effects.[A1492]"
DB00968,"Methyldopa, or α-methyldopa, is a centrally acting sympatholytic agent and an antihypertensive agent.[A231784] It is an analog of DOPA (3,4‐hydroxyphenylanine), and it is a prodrug, meaning that the drug requires biotransformation to an active metabolite for therapeutic effects. Methyldopa works by binding to alpha(α)-2 adrenergic receptors as an agonist, leading to the inhibition of adrenergic neuronal outflow and reduction of vasoconstrictor adrenergic signals.[A1499] Methyldopa exists in two isomers D-α-methyldopa and L-α-methyldopa, which is the active form.[A232224]

First introduced in 1960 as an antihypertensive agent, methyldopa was considered to be useful in certain patient populations, such as pregnant women and patients with renal insufficiency. Since then, methyldopa was largely replaced by newer, better-tolerated antihypertensive agents;[A231784] however, it is still used as monotherapy [L32614] or in combination with [hydrochlorothiazide].[L32619] Methyldopa is also available as intravenous injection, which is used to manage hypertension when oral therapy is unfeasible and to treat hypertensive crisis.[L32624]"
DB00969,"Alosetron is a 5-HT3 antagonist used only for the management of severe diarrhoea-predominant irritable bowel syndrome (IBS) in women. Alosetron has an antagonist action on the 5-HT3 receptors and thus may modulate serotonin-sensitive gastrointestinal (GI) processes. Alosetron was voluntarily withdrawn from the US market in November 2000 by the manufacturer due to numerous reports of severe adverse effects including ischemic colitis, severely obstructed or ruptured bowel, and death. In June 2002, the FDA approved a supplemental new drug application allowing the remarketing of the drug under restricted conditions of use."

DB01001,"Salbutamol is a short-acting, selective beta2-adrenergic receptor agonist used in the treatment of asthma and COPD. It is 29 times more selective for beta2 receptors than beta1 receptors giving it higher specificity for pulmonary beta receptors versus beta1-adrenergic receptors located in the heart. Salbutamol is formulated as a racemic mixture of the R- and S-isomers. The R-isomer has 150 times greater affinity for the beta2-receptor than the S-isomer and the S-isomer has been associated with toxicity. This lead to the development of levalbuterol, the single R-isomer of salbutamol. However, the high cost of levalbuterol compared to salbutamol has deterred wide-spread use of this enantiomerically pure version of the drug. Salbutamol is generally used for acute episodes of bronchospasm caused by bronchial asthma, chronic bronchitis and other chronic bronchopulmonary disorders such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD). It is also used prophylactically for exercise-induced asthma.[Label,A174379,A174400]"
DB01002,"Levobupivacaine is an amino-amide local anaesthetic drug belonging to the family of n-alkylsubstituted
pipecoloxylidide. It is the S-enantiomer of bupivacaine. Levobupivacaine hydrochloride is commonly marketed by AstraZeneca under the trade name Chirocaine. In particular, the specific levobupivacaine enantiomer is a worthwhile pursuit because it demonstrates less vasodilation and possesses a greater length of action in comparison to bupivacaine. It is approximately 13 per cent less potent (by molarity) than racemic bupivacaine.Levobupivacaine is indicated for local anaesthesia including infiltration, nerve block, ophthalmic, epidural and intrathecal anaesthesia in adults; and infiltration analgesia in children. When administered appropriately, the occurrence of adverse effects is not anticipated much if at all. In general, the majority of potential adverse effects are predominantly associated with inappropriate administration methods that may cause systemic exposure and/or toxicity associated with overexposure to an anesthetic. Regardless, allergic reactions may also occur - although only rarely."

An advantage of bethanechol is that in contrast to acetylcholine, bethanechol is not degraded by cholinesterase allowing its effects to be longer-lasting.[L32539]"
DB01020,"Isosorbide mononitrate is an organic nitrate with vasodilating properties. It is an anti-anginal agent that works by relaxing the smooth muscles of both arteries and veins, but but predominantly veins to reduce cardiac preload.[L11698, L11743] Isosorbide mononitrate is an active metabolite of [isosorbide dinitrate]. Like other organic nitrates, isosorbide mononitrate acts as a prodrug for its active metabolite, [nitric oxide], which mediates the therapeutic action of isosorbide mononitrate.[L11743] Isosorbide mononitrate has a longer duration of action than [nitroglycerin] due to its slow onset of absorption and metabolism.[T28]

First approved by the FDA in 1991,[L11743] isosorbide mononitrate is used for the prevention and management of angina pectoris caused by coronary artery disease; however, the onset of action of orally-administered isosorbide mononitrate is not rapid enough to offset an acute anginal episode.[L11698] It is available in oral tablets generically and under the brand name ISMO and Monoket. The extended-release forms of the drug are also available generically and under the brand name Imdur.[L11743]"
DB01023,"Felodipine is a long-acting 1,4-dihydropyridine calcium channel blocker (CCB)b. It acts primarily on vascular smooth muscle cells by stabilizing voltage-gated L-type calcium channels in their inactive conformation. By inhibiting the influx of calcium in smooth muscle cells, felodipine prevents calcium-dependent myocyte contraction and vasoconstriction. Felodipine is the most potent CCB in use and is unique in that it exhibits fluorescent activity. In addition to binding to L-type calcium channels, felodipine binds to a number of calcium-binding proteins, exhibits competitive antagonism of the mineralcorticoid receptor, inhibits the activity of calmodulin-dependent cyclic nucleotide phosphodiesterase, and blocks calcium influx through voltage-gated T-type calcium channels. Felodipine is used to treat mild to moderate essential hypertension."

It is different from many other Alzheimer's Disease medications, as it works by a different mechanism than the cholinesterase enzyme inhibitors normally employed in the management of Alzheimer's disease [A1639].  Memantine blocks the effects of glutamate, a neurotransmitter in the brain that leads to neuronal excitability and excessive stimulation in Alzheimer's Disease [T556].

In 2010, it was estimated that 36 million people worldwide live with Alzheimer's Disease. In 2013, this number increased to 44 million.  Almost doubling every 20 years, the prevalence of Alzheimer's Disease is predicted to reach 66 million by 2030 and to 115 million by 2050 [F4366].

DB01050,"Ibuprofen is a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) derived from propionic acid and it is considered the first of the propionics.[A39074] The formula of ibuprofen is 2-(4-isobutylphenyl) propionic acid and its initial development was in 1960 while researching for a safer alternative for aspirin.[A39075] Ibuprofen was finally patented in 1961 and this drug was first launched against rheumatoid arthritis in the UK in 1969 and USA in 1974. It was the first available over-the-counter NSAID.[A39076]

On the available products, ibuprofen is administered as a racemic mixture. Once administered, the R-enantiomer undergoes extensive interconversion to the S-enantiomer _in vivo_ by the activity of the alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase. In particular, it is generally proposed that the S-enantiomer is capable of eliciting stronger pharmacological activity than the R-enantiomer.[A39194]"

However, it also has antiemetic, antitussive, hypnotic, and antiparkinson properties [L5269, F3352]. As histamine receptors exist both peripherally and in the central nervous system, diphenhydramine has been shown to cause sedation due to its competitive antagonism of histamine H1 receptors within the central nervous system [L5263, L5266, L5269, F3379, A174541]. While its use in allergy therapy can sometimes fall out of favor due to its sedative effect, diphenhydramine has been repurposed for use within many non-prescription over-the-counter sleep aids and cough-and-cold medications that have been marketed for ""night time"" use [L5263, L5281, L5287]. 

Diphenhydramine is also used in combination with [DB14132] as the anti-nausea drug [DB00985] where it is utilized primarily for its antagonism of H1 histamine receptors within the vestibular system [A1540].

Diphenhydramine has also been shown to be implicated in a number of neurotransmitter systems that affect behaviour including dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin, acetylcholine, and opioid [A1539]. As a result, diphenhydramine is being investigated for its anxiolytic and anti-depressant properties."

More specifically, statin medications competitively inhibit the enzyme hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) Reductase,[A181421] which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonic acid. This conversion is a critical metabolic reaction involved in the production of several compounds involved in lipid metabolism and transport, including cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (sometimes referred to as ""bad cholesterol""), and very-low-density lipoprotein (VLDL). Prescribing statins is considered standard practice for patients following any cardiovascular event, and for people who are at moderate to high risk of developing cardiovascular disease. The evidence supporting statin use, coupled with minimal side effects and long term benefits, has resulted in wide use of this medication in North America.[A181087, A181406]

Atorvastatin and other statins including [lovastatin], [pravastatin], [rosuvastatin], [fluvastatin], and [simvastatin] are considered first-line treatment options for dyslipidemia.[A181087, A181406] The increasing use of this class of drugs is largely attributed to the rise in cardiovascular diseases (CVD) (such as heart attack, atherosclerosis, angina, peripheral artery disease, and stroke) in many countries.[A181084] An elevated cholesterol level (elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels in particular) is a significant risk factor for the development of CVD.[A181087,A181553] Several landmark studies demonstrate that the use of statins is associated with both a reduction in LDL levels and CVD risk.[A181090,A181093,A181096,A181427,A181475,A181538] Statins were shown to reduce the incidences of all-cause mortality, including fatal and non-fatal CVD, as well as the need for surgical revascularization or angioplasty following a heart attack.[A181087, A181406] Some evidence has shown that even for low-risk individuals (with <10% risk of a major vascular event occurring within five years) statin use leads to a 20%-22% relative reduction in the number of major cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke, coronary revascularization, and coronary death) for every 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL without any significant side effects or risks.[A181397, A181403]

Atorvastatin was first synthesized in 1985 by Dr. Bruce Roth and approved by the FDA in 1996.[T568] It is a pentasubstituted pyrrole [A177415] formed by two contrasting moieties with an achiral heterocyclic core unit and a 3,5-dihydroxypentanoyl side chain identical to its parent compound.[T571] Unlike other members of the statin group, atorvastatin is an active compound and therefore does not require activation.[A177436]"
DB01080,"Vigabatrin is an analog of gamma-aminobutyric acid ([GABA]), the main inhibitory neurotransmitter in the central nervous system, used in the treatment of refractory seizures and infantile spasms.[L13616] It irreversibly inhibits the enzyme responsible for GABA metabolism, thereby increasing levels of circulating GABA. Although administered as a racemic mixture, only the S(+) enantiomer is pharmacologically active.[A202037]

It was first introduced as an antiepileptic agent in the United Kingdom in 1989 and was used extensively until 1997, when an association with vision loss became apparent.[A202124] Its use is now generally reserved for patients who have failed alternative therapies, and its US approval by the FDA in 2009 mandated the creation of a drug registry to monitor patients for visual deficits.[L13661,A202124]"
DB01083,"The global prevalence of obesity is increasing rapidly. Obesity-related complications lead to significant personal and economic burden by reducing quality of life and increasing the cost of healthcare.  In some individuals, diet and exercise are insufficient to maintain weight loss, and pharmacological or surgical intervention is required.[A229928]

Orlistat is a lipase inhibitor used in the treatment of obesity that works by inhibiting fat-metabolizing enzymes. It was approved by the FDA for use in combination with a reduced-calorie diet in 1999.[L11130] This drug is a generally well-tolerated and effective weight-loss aid and is now available in both over-the-counter[L31963] and prescription preparations, depending on the dosage quantity.[L11130]"

DB01095,"Fluvastatin is an antilipemic agent that competitively inhibits hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) reductase. HMG-CoA reductase catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonic acid, the rate-limiting step in cholesterol biosynthesis. Fluvastatin belongs to a class of medications called statins and is used to reduce plasma cholesterol levels and prevent cardiovascular disease. It is also the first entirely synthetic HMG-CoA reductase inhibitor and is structurally distinct from the fungal derivatives of this therapeutic class. Fluvastatin is a racemate comprising equimolar amounts of (3R,5S)- and (3S,5R)-fluvastatin."
DB01098,"Rosuvastatin, also known as the brand name product Crestor, is a lipid-lowering drug that belongs to the statin class of medications, which are used to lower the risk of cardiovascular disease and manage elevated lipid levels by inhibiting the endogenous production of cholesterol in the liver. More specifically, statin medications competitively inhibit the enzyme hydroxymethylglutaryl-coenzyme A (HMG-CoA) Reductase,[A181421] which catalyzes the conversion of HMG-CoA to mevalonic acid and is the third step in a sequence of metabolic reactions involved in the production of several compounds involved in lipid metabolism and transport including cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) (sometimes referred to as ""bad cholesterol""), and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL). Prescribing of statin medications is considered standard practice following any cardiovascular events and for people with a moderate to high risk of development of CVD, such as those with Type 2 Diabetes. The clear evidence of the benefit of statin use coupled with very minimal side effects or long term effects has resulted in this class becoming one of the most widely prescribed medications in North America.[A181087, A181406]

Rosuvastatin and other drugs from the statin class of medications including [atorvastatin], [pravastatin], [simvastatin], [fluvastatin], and [lovastatin] are considered first-line options for the treatment of dyslipidemia.[A181087, A181406] This is largely due to the fact that cardiovascular disease (CVD), which includes heart attack, atherosclerosis, angina, peripheral artery disease, and stroke, has become a leading cause of death in high-income countries and a major cause of morbidity around the world.[A181084] Elevated cholesterol levels, and in particular, elevated low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels, are an important risk factor for the development of CVD.[A181087,A181553] Use of statins to target and reduce LDL levels has been shown in a number of landmark studies to significantly reduce the risk of development of CVD and all-cause mortality.[A181090,A181093,A181096,A181427,A181475,A181538] Statins are considered a cost-effective treatment option for CVD due to their evidence of reducing all-cause mortality including fatal and non-fatal CVD as well as the need for surgical revascularization or angioplasty following a heart attack.[A181087, A181406] Evidence has shown that even for low-risk individuals (with <10% risk of a major vascular event occurring within 5 years) statins cause a 20%-22% relative reduction in major cardiovascular events (heart attack, stroke, coronary revascularization, and coronary death) for every 1 mmol/L reduction in LDL without any significant side effects or risks.[A181397, A181403]

While all statin medications are considered equally effective from a clinical standpoint, rosuvastatin is considered the most potent; doses of 10 to 40mg rosuvastatin per day were found in clinical studies to result in a 45.8% to 54.6% decreases in LDL cholesterol levels, which is about three-fold more potent than [atorvastatin]'s effects on LDL cholesterol.[A181409,A1793] However, the results of the SATURN trial[A181427] concluded that despite this difference in potency, there was no difference in their effect on the progression of coronary atherosclerosis.

Rosuvastatin is also a unique member of the class of statins due to its high hydrophilicity which increases hepatic uptake at the site of action, low bioavailability, and minimal metabolism via the Cytochrome P450 system.[A181523] This last point results in less risk of drug-drug interactions compared to [atorvastatin], [lovastatin], and [simvastatin], which are all extensively metabolized by Cytochrome P450 (CYP) 3A4, an enzyme involved in the metabolism of many commonly used drugs.[A181460] Drugs such as [ciclosporin], [gemfibrozil], and some antiretrovirals are more likely to interact with this statin through antagonism of OATP1B1 organic anion transporter protein 1B1-mediated hepatic uptake of rosuvastatin.[F4649, F4652]"

DB01104,"Sertraline is a popular antidepressant medication commonly known as a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI), and is similar to drugs such as [Citalopram] and [Fluoxetine]. Despite marked structural differences between compounds in this drug class, SSRIs exert similar pharmacological effects.

Several weeks of therapy with sertraline may be required before beneficial effects are noticed. Sertraline displays enhanced safety or tolerability than other classes of antidepressants, which frequently cause high levels of drowsiness, dizziness, blurred vision, and other undesirable effects.[A1846,A187075,T28]"
DB01105,"Sibutramine (trade name Meridia in the USA, Reductil in Europe and other countries), usually as sibutramide hydrochloride monohydrate, is an orally administered agent for the treatment of obesity. It is a centrally acting stimulant chemically related to amphetamines thus it is classified as a Schedule IV controlled substance in the United States. In October 2010, Sibutramine was withdrawn from Canadian and U.S. markets due to concerns that the drug increases the risk of heart attack and stroke in patients with a history of heart disease."
DB01109,"Unfractionated heparin (UH) is a heterogenous preparation of anionic, sulfated glycosaminoglycan polymers with weights ranging from 3000 to 30,000 Da. It is a naturally occurring anticoagulant released from mast cells. It binds reversibly to antithrombin III (ATIII) and greatly accelerates the rate at which ATIII inactivates coagulation enzymes thrombin (factor IIa) and factor Xa. UH is different from low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) in the following ways: the average molecular weight of LMWH is about 4.5 kDa whereas it is 15 kDa for UH; UH requires continuous infusions; activated partial prothrombin time (aPTT) monitoring is required when using UH; and UH has a higher risk of bleeding and higher risk of osteoporosis in long term use. Unfractionated heparin is more specific than LMWH for thrombin. Furthermore, the effects of UH can typically be reversed by using protamine sulfate."

DB01120,"Gliclazide is an oral antihyperglycemic agent used for the treatment of non-insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM). It has been classified differently according to its drug properties in which based on its chemical structure, gliclazide is considered a first-generation sulfonylurea due to the structural presence of a sulfonamide group able to release a proton and the presence of one aromatic group.[A39546] On the other hand, based on the pharmacological efficacy, gliclazide is considered a second-generation sulfonylurea which presents a higher potency and a shorter half-life.[T238, T360] Gliclazide belongs to the sulfonylurea class of insulin secretagogues, which act by stimulating &beta; cells of the pancreas to release insulin. Sulfonylureas increase both basal insulin secretion and meal-stimulated insulin release. Medications in this class differ in their dose, rate of absorption, duration of action, route of elimination and binding site on their target pancreatic &beta; cell receptor. Sulfonylureas also increase peripheral glucose utilization, decrease hepatic gluconeogenesis and may increase the number and sensitivity of insulin receptors. Sulfonylureas are associated with weight gain, though less so than insulin. Due to their mechanism of action, sulfonylureas may cause hypoglycemia and require consistent food intake to decrease this risk. The risk of hypoglycemia is increased in elderly, debilitated and malnourished individuals. Gliclazide has been shown to decrease fasting plasma glucose, postprandial blood glucose and glycosolated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels (reflective of the last 8-10 weeks of glucose control). Gliclazide is extensively metabolized by the liver; its metabolites are excreted in both urine (60-70%) and feces (10-20%)."

DB01151,"Desipramine hydrochloride is a dibenzazepine-derivative tricyclic antidepressant (TCA). TCAs are structurally similar to phenothiazines. They contain a tricyclic ring system with an alkyl amine substituent on the central ring. In non-depressed individuals, desipramine does not affect mood or arousal, but may cause sedation. In depressed individuals, desipramine exerts a positive effect on mood. TCAs are potent inhibitors of serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake. Secondary amine TCAs, such as desipramine and nortriptyline, are more potent inhibitors of norepinephrine reuptake than tertiary amine TCAs, such as amitriptyline and doxepine. TCAs also down-regulate cerebral cortical &beta;-adrenergic receptors and sensitize post-synaptic serotonergic receptors with chronic use. The antidepressant effects of TCAs are thought to be due to an overall increase in serotonergic neurotransmission. TCAs also block histamine-H<sub>1</sub> receptors, &alpha;<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic receptors and muscarinic receptors, which accounts for their sedative, hypotensive and anticholinergic effects (e.g. blurred vision, dry mouth, constipation, urinary retention), respectively. See toxicity section below for a complete listing of side effects. Desipramine exerts less anticholinergic and sedative side effects compared to tertiary amine TCAs, such as amitriptyline and clomipramine. Desipramine may be used to treat depression, neuropathic pain (unlabeled use), agitation and insomnia (unlabeled use) and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (unlabeled use)."
DB01156,"Bupropion (also known as the brand name product Wellbutrin®) is a norepinephrine/dopamine-reuptake inhibitor (NDRI) used most commonly for the management of Major Depressive Disorder (MDD), Seasonal Affective Disorder (SAD), and as an aid for smoking cessation. Bupropion exerts its pharmacological effects by weakly inhibiting the enzymes involved in the uptake of the neurotransmitters norepinephrine and dopamine from the synaptic cleft, therefore prolonging their duration of action within the neuronal synapse and the downstream effects of these neurotransmitters. More specifically, bupropion binds to the norepinephrine transporter (NET) and the dopamine transporter (DAT).[A6399,A178810]

Bupropion was originally classified as an ""atypical"" antidepressant because it does not exert the same effects as the classical antidepressants such as Monoamine Oxidase Inhibitors (MAOIs), Tricyclic Antidepressants (TCAs), or Selective Serotonin Reuptake Inhibitors (SSRIs). While it has comparable effectiveness to typical first-line options for the treatment of depression such as SSRIs,[A178798,A178804] bupropion is a unique option for the treatment of MDD as it lacks any clinically relevant serotonergic effects, typical of other mood medications, or any effects on histamine or adrenaline receptors.[A6399,A178840] Lack of activity at these receptors results in a more tolerable side effect profile; bupropion is less likely to cause sexual side effects, sedation, or weight gain as compared to SSRIs or TCAs, for example.[A178804,A178807]

When used as an aid to smoking cessation, bupropion is thought to confer its anti-craving and anti-withdrawal effects by inhibiting dopamine reuptake, which is thought to be involved in the reward pathways associated with nicotine, and through the antagonism of the nicotinic acetylcholinergic receptor.[A178825,A1966,A16508] A Cochrane Review of meta-analyses of available treatment modalities for smoking cessation found that abstinence rates approximately doubled when bupropion was used as compared to placebo, and was found to have similar rates of smoking cessation as [nicotine] replacement therapy (NRT).[A178816]

Bupropion is sometimes used as an add-on agent to first-line treatments of depression such as selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI) medications when there is a treatment-failure or only partial response.[A178789] Bupropion is also used off-label for the management of Attention/Deficit-Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD) in adults with comorbid bipolar depression to avoid mood destabilization caused by typical stimulant medications used for the treatment of ADHD.[F4624]

When used in combination with [naltrexone] in the marketed product ContraveⓇ for chronic weight management, the two components are thought to have effects on areas of the brain involved in the regulation of food intake. This includes the hypothalamus, which is involved in appetite regulation, and the mesolimbic dopamine circuit, which is involved in reward pathways.[L6562] Studies have shown that the combined activity of bupropion and [naltrexone] increase the firing rate of hypothalamic pro-opiomelanocortin (POMC) neurons and blockade of opioid receptor-mediated POMC auto-inhibition, which are associated with a reduction in food intake and increased energy expenditure.[L6562,A179038,A179050] The combination of naltrexone and bupropion was shown to result in a statistically significant weight loss, with a mean change in body weight of -6.3% compared to -1.3% for placebo.[A179047]"

On June 8, 2017, FDA requested Endo Pharmaceuticals to remove the medication from the market due to opioid misuse and abuse risks associated with the product's injectable reformulation."
DB01193,A cardioselective beta-adrenergic antagonist with little effect on the bronchial receptors. The drug has stabilizing and quinidine-like effects on cardiac rhythm as well as weak inherent sympathomimetic action.
DB01194,"Brinzolamide is a highly specific, non-competitive, reversible carbonic anhydrase II (CA-II) inhibitor indicated to reduce ocular pressure in patients with ocular hypertension or open-angle glaucoma.[L35310] Although the exact pathophysiology of glaucoma is still unknown, one of the main hallmarks of this disease is vascular dysregulation and abnormalities.[A2049,A2051] The resulting vascular resistance increases intraocular pressure, thus impairing ocular perfusion.[A2049,A2051] Although systemic anti-carbonic anhydrase (CA) therapy has been used for almost 50 years with varying degrees of success, systemic administration results in an increase in incidences of adverse effects.[A2049,A2051]

Brinzolamide was developed as a topical solution to the systemic side effects and [dorzolamide], the first-ever approved topical CA inhibitor with contrasting results and evidence.[A2051] Unlike [dorzolamide], brinzolamide has a higher lipophilicity to facilitate diffusion across the blood-retinal barrier.[A2051] Brinzolamide was approved by the FDA in 1998 as a standalone product and in 2013 as a combination product with brimonidine tartrate.[L35310,L35315] In Europe, it was also approved as a combination product with timolol in 2008.[L35320]"

DB01200,"Bromocriptine mesylate is a semisynthetic ergot alkaloid derivative with potent dopaminergic activity. It inhibits prolactin secretion and may be used to treat dysfunctions associated with hyperprolactinemia. Bromocriptine is also indicated for the management of signs and symptoms of Parkinsonian Syndrome, as well as the treatment of acromegaly. Bromocriptine has been associated with pulmonary fibrosis, and can also cause sustained suppression of somatotropin (growth hormone) secretion in some patients with acromegaly.

In 1995, the FDA withdrew the approval of bromocriptine mesylate for the prevention of physiological lactation after finding that bromocriptine was not shown to be safe for use.[L43942,L43947] It continues to be used for the indications mentioned above."
DB01202,"Levetiracetam is a drug within the pyrrolidine class that is used to treat various types of seizures stemming from epileptic disorders. It was first approved for use in the United States in 1999 and is structurally and mechanistically unrelated to other anti-epileptic drugs (AEDs).[L8606,L8600,L8615] Levetiracetam possesses a wide therapeutic index[L8615,A185918] and little-to-no potential to produce, or be subject to, pharmacokinetic interactions[L8606,L8600,L8615] - these characteristics make it a desirable choice over other AEDs, a class of drugs notorious for having generally narrow therapeutic indexes and a propensity for involvement in drug interactions.[A185927]"
DB01203,"Nadolol is a nonselective beta adrenal receptor blocker that is used to lower blood pressure.[L7922,L7925] Nonselective beta adrenal receptor blockers may no longer be first line in the treatment of hypertension as newer generations of beta adrenal receptor blockers have higher selectivity and offer better rates of adverse effects.[A34177]

DB01216,"Finasteride is a synthetic 4-azasteroid compound [L10565] and specific inhibitor of steroid Type II 5α-reductase, which is an intracellular enzyme that converts the androgen testosterone into 5α-dihydrotestosterone (DHT). It works in a similar fashion as [dutasteride], which is another 5-alpha-reductase inhibitor, by exerting antiandrogenic effects. Finasteride is an orally active drug that was first approved by the FDA in 1992 for the treatment of benign prostatic hyperplasia to improve symptoms and reduce the risk for acute urinary retention or the need for surgical procedures.[L6244,L10565] In 1998, it was approved by the FDA to treat male pattern hair loss.[L6244] Finasteride is commonly marketed under the brand names Propecia and Proscar to be used aloneo or in combination with [doxazosin], an alpha-blocker.

Both benign prostatic hyperplasia and androgenic alopecia are androgen-dependent disorders that are characterized by _in situ_ high levels of DHT.[A178159] In the treatment of benign prostate hyperplasia, alpha-blockers such as [tamsulosin] and [terazosin] are also used. Compared to alpha-blockers that focus on providing the rapid relief of symptoms, 5α-reductase inhibitors aim to target the underlying disease by blocking the effects of the primary androgen involved in benign prostate hyperplasia and androgenic alopecia, thus reducing the risk for secondary complications while providing symptom control.[A2132]"
DB01217,"Anastrozole is a non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor (AI), similar to [letrozole], used to decrease circulating estrogen levels in the treatment of postmenopausal women with estrogen-responsive breast cancer.[L8863] Anastrozole is also related to [exemestane], a steroidal AI, but its non-steroidal nature provides stark advantages including a lack of steroid-associated adverse effects such as weight gain and acne.[A186865] Aromatase inhibitors, including anastrozole, have become endocrine drugs of choice in the treatment of postmenopausal breast cancer due to a more favourable efficacy and adverse effect profile as compared to earlier estrogen receptor modulators such as [tamoxifen].[A186877,A186955]

Anastrozole was first approved for use in the United States in 1995.[L8863]"

DB01232,"Saquinavir is an HIV-1 protease inhibitor used in combination with [ritonavir] and other antiretrovirals for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) infection. In 1995 it became the first protease inhibitor approved by the FDA, followed shortly by ritonavir in 1996, and remains in clinical use today due to a relatively benign adverse effect profile as compared to other antiretroviral therapies.[A214382] While its efficacy was initially limited by exceptionally poor oral bioavailability (approximately 4%),[L3450] its current indications require the co-administration of ritonavir - a potent enzyme inhibitor - that increases the bioavailability and subsequent serum concentrations of saquinavir, thus dramatically improving antiviral activity.[A214382,L3450,L14351]"
DB01233,"Diabetic gastroparesis is a condition that causes frequent nausea and vomiting, which has a negative impact on quality of life and poses a significant burden on the healthcare system.[A184934] Metoclopramide is a dopamine antagonist used to treat nausea and vomiting that may be associated with diabetic gastroparesis in addition to gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). It can also be used to prevent nausea or vomiting associated with chemotherapy or certain surgical or diagnostic procedures.[L8417] 

One unique property of this drug is that it does not increase gastric acid secretion. It is available in the oral tablet form or in solution, and can also be administered through the intravenous route.[T683] Metoclopramide was initially approved by the FDA in 1980.[A184922]"

Dexamethasone reduced deaths by approximately one third in patients requiring ventilation and by one fifth in those requiring oxygen.[L14318]"
DB01235,"Levodopa is a prodrug of dopamine that is administered to patients with Parkinson's due to its ability to cross the blood-brain barrier[Label]. Levodopa can be metabolised to dopamine on either side of the blood-brain barrier and so it is generally administered with a dopa decarboxylase inhibitor like carbidopa to prevent metabolism until after it has crossed the blood-brain barrier[Label,A177781]. Once past the blood-brain barrier, levodopa is metabolized to dopamine and supplements the low endogenous levels of dopamine to treat symptoms of Parkinson's[Label]. The first developed drug product that was approved by the FDA was a levodopa and carbidopa combined product called Sinemet that was approved on May 2, 1975[A177781,L6133]."
DB01238,"Aripiprazole is an atypical antipsychotic orally indicated for the treatment of schizophrenia, bipolar I, major depressive disorder, irritability associated with autism, and Tourette's.[L45859] It is also indicated as an injection for agitation associated with schizophrenia or bipolar mania.[L45859] Aripiprazole exerts its effects through agonism of dopaminergic and 5-HT1A receptors and antagonism of alpha-adrenergic and 5-HT2A receptors.[L45859,A4393] Aripiprazole was given FDA approval on November 15, 2002.[L6136]"

DB01242,"Clomipramine, the 3-chloro analog of imipramine, is a dibenzazepine-derivative tricyclic antidepressant (TCA). TCAs are structurally similar to phenothiazines. They contain a tricyclic ring system with an alkyl amine substituent on the central ring. In non-depressed individuals, clomipramine does not affect mood or arousal, but may cause sedation. In depressed individuals, clomipramine exerts a positive effect on mood. TCAs are potent inhibitors of serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake. Tertiary amine TCAs, such as clomipramine, are more potent inhibitors of serotonin reuptake than secondary amine TCAs, such as nortriptyline and desipramine. TCAs also down-regulate cerebral cortical &beta;-adrenergic receptors and sensitize post-synaptic serotonergic receptors with chronic use. The antidepressant effects of TCAs are thought to be due to an overall increase in serotonergic neurotransmission. TCAs also block histamine-H<sub>1</sub> receptors, &alpha;<sub>1</sub>-adrenergic receptors and muscarinic receptors, which accounts for their sedative, hypotensive and anticholinergic effects (e.g. blurred vision, dry mouth, constipation, urinary retention), respectively. See toxicity section below for a complete listing of side effects. Clomipramine may be used to treat obsessive-compulsive disorder and disorders with an obsessive-compulsive component (e.g. depression, schizophrenia, Tourette’s disorder). Unlabeled indications include panic disorder, chronic pain (e.g. central pain, idiopathic pain disorder, tension headache, diabetic peripheral neuropathy, neuropathic pain), cataplexy and associated narcolepsy, autistic disorder, trichotillomania, onchophagia, stuttering, premature ejaculation, and premenstrual syndrome. Clomipramine is rapidly absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and demethylated in the liver to its primary active metabolite, desmethylclomipramine."
DB01244,"A long-acting, non selective, calcium channel blocker with significant anti-anginal activity. The drug produces significant coronary vasodilation and modest peripheral effects. It has antihypertensive and selective anti-arrhythmia activities and acts as a calmodulin antagonist. It is no longer marketed in the United States, as it has been implicated in causing ventricular arrhythmias (ie. Torsade de pointes)."
DB01248,"Docetaxel is a clinically well established anti-mitotic chemotherapy medication used for the treatment of different types of cancer, including breast, ovarian, and non-small cell lung cancer. Docetaxel is a complex diterpenoid molecule and a semisynthetic analogue of [paclitaxel].[A259676,L46466] Docetaxel reversibly binds to microtubulin with high affinity in a 1:1 stoichiometric ratio, allowing it to prevent cell division and promote to cell death.[A259676] Compared to paclitaxel, docetaxel is two times more potent as an inhibitor of microtubule depolymerization. Docetaxel binds to microtubules but does not interact with dimeric tubulin.[A259671]

The use of docetaxel may lead to udesired outcomes such as hepatic impairment, hematologic effects, enterocolitis and neutropenic colitis, hypersensitivity reactions, fluid retention, second primary malignancies, embryo-fetal toxicity, and tumor lysis syndrome.[L46466] Docetaxel was approved by the FDA in 1996 and is available in solution for injection for intravenous or parenteral administration.[A259676]"
DB01254,"Dasatinib is an orally available multikinase inhibitor indicated for the treatment of Philadelphia chromosome (Ph)-positive leukemias.[A2224,L45171] Ph is a chromosomal abnormality found in patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) and acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL), where the ABL tyrosine kinase and the breakpoint cluster region (BCR) gene transcribe the chimeric protein BCR-ABL. BCR-ABL is associated with the uncontrolled activity of the ABL tyrosine kinase and is involved in the pathogenesis of CML and 15-30% of ALL cases.[A11377,A33432] Dasatinib also inhibits a spectrum of kinases involved in cancer, including several SRC-family kinases.[A11377] 

Unlike [imatinib], another tyrosine kinase used for the treatment of CML and Ph-positive ALL, dasatinib inhibits the active and inactive conformations of the ABL kinase domain.[A2226,A11377] Also, mutations in the kinase domain of BCR-ABL may lead to relapse during imatinib treatment. Since dasatinib does not interact with some of the residues involved in those mutations, the use of this drug represents a therapeutic alternative for patients with cancers that have developed imatinib-resistance.[A2226] The use of dasatinib was first approved by the FDA in 2006.[L45171,L45186]"
DB01255,"Lisdexamfetamine is a prodrug of [dextroamphetamine], a central nervous system stimulant known as d-amphetamine,[A40246] covalently attached to the naturally occurring amino acid L-lysine.[A2230] Lisdexamfetamine is the first chemically formulated prodrug stimulant [A40246] and was first approved by the FDA in April 2008.[A2230] It was also approved by Health Canada in February 2009.[L48285] Lisdexamfetamine works to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and binge eating disorder [A2230] by blocking dopamine and norepinephrine reuptake and increasing their levels in the extraneuronal space.[L48280]"

The effect of this medication leads to glucose dependent increases in insulin and decreases in glucagon to improve control of blood sugar[FDA label,A2255]. Sitagliptin was granted FDA approval on October 16, 2006[L6061]."
DB01262,"Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) are a heterogeneous group of hematopoietic neoplasms with variable underlying etiology and presentation, including neutropenia and thrombocytopenia. Further mutations leading to increased proliferation of cancerous cells can eventually lead to secondary acute myeloid leukemia, which has a poor prognosis.[A215082, A215092] Among treatment options, nucleoside analogues such as decitabine and [azacitidine] integrate into cellular DNA and inhibit the action of DNA methyltransferases, leading to global hypomethylation and related downstream therapeutic benefits.[A2263, A2264, A2265, A215317, L14962]

DB01267,"Paliperidone is the primary active metabolite of risperidone. The mechanism of action is unknown but it is likely to act via a similar pathway to risperidone. It has been proposed that the drug's therapeutic activity in schizophrenia is mediated through a combination of central dopamine Type 2 (D2) and serotonin Type 2 (5HT2A) receptor antagonism. Paliperidone is also active as an antagonist at alpha 1 and alpha 2 adrenergic receptors and H1 histaminergic receptors, which may explain some of the other effects of the drug. Paliperidone was approved by the FDA for treatment of schizophrenia on December 20, 2006. It is available as an extended-release tablet, a once-monthly intramuscular injection, an every-three-month intramuscular injection, and a twice-yearly gluteal injection.[L16168,L37744,L4137,L37749]"

DB01291,"Pirbuterol is a beta-2 adrenergic bronchodilator. In vitro studies and in vivo pharmacologic studies have demonstrated that pirbuterol has a preferential effect on beta-2 Adrenergic receptors compared with isoproterenol. While it is recognized that beta-2 adrenergic receptors are the predominant receptors in bronchial smooth muscle, data indicate that there is a population of beta-2 receptors in the human heart, existing in a concentration between 10-50%. The precise function of these receptors has not been established.

The pharmacologic effects of beta adrenergic agonist drugs, including pirbuterol, are at least in proof attributable to stimulation through beta adrenergic receptors of intracellular adenyl cyclase, the enzyme which catalyzes the conversion of adenosine triphosphate (AlP) to cyclic-3† ,5†-adenosine monophosphate (c-AMP). Increased c-AMP levels are associated with relaxation of bronchial smooth muscle and inhibition of release of mediators of immediate hypersensitivity from cells, especially from mast cells."
DB01296,"Osteoarthritis (OA) is a progressive and degenerative joint disease marked by loss of cartilage, bone changes, and synovial membrane inflammation.[A232289] Treatment with chondroprotective drugs, such as glucosamine sulfate may offer additional benefits to nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs treating the painful symptoms of OA. Glucosamine is commonly used over the counter as a treatment for arthritic joint pain, although its acceptance as a medical therapy varies due to contradictory and findings with unclear clinical significance during clinical trials.[A231894,A232289] It is currently not approved as a prescription product by the FDA, but is widely available over the counter."

DB01356,"Lithium was used during the 19th century to treat gout. Lithium salts such as lithium carbonate (Li2CO3), lithium citrate, and lithium orotate are mood stabilizers. They are used in the treatment of bipolar disorder, since unlike most other mood altering drugs, they counteract both mania and depression. Lithium can also be used to augment other antidepressant drugs. It is also sometimes prescribed as a preventive treatment for migraine disease and cluster headaches. The active principle in these salts is the lithium ion Li+, which having a smaller diameter, can easily displace K+ and Na+ and even Ca+2, in spite of its greater charge, occupying their sites in several critical neuronal enzymes and neurotransmitter receptors."
DB01359,"Penbutolol is a drug in the beta-blocker class used to treat hypertension. Penbutolol binds both beta-1 and beta-2 adrenergic receptors, rendering it a non-selective beta-blocker. Penbutolol can act as a partial agonist at beta adrenergic receptors, since it is a sympathomimetric drug. Penbutolol also demonstrates high binding affinity to the 5-hydroxytryptamine receptor 1A with antagonistic effects. This binding characteristic of penbutolol is being investigated for its implications in Antidepressant Therapy. Penbutolol is contraindicated in patients with cardiogenic shock, sinus bradycardia, second and third degree atrioventricular conduction block, bronchial asthma, and those with known hypersensitivity."
DB01364,"Ephedrine was first described in western literature in 1888, as a naturally occurring component of the ephedra plant, along with [pseudoephedrine].[A193698] Ephedrine acts as both a direct and indirect sympathomimetic. It is an alpha- and beta-adrenergic receptor agonist; however, it also causes the indirect release of norepinephrine from sympathetic neurons, inhibiting norepinephrine reuptake and displacing more norepinephrine from storage vesicles.[A193650,L12972] Ephedrine is used for its vasoconstrictive, positive chronotropic, and positive inotropic effects.[L12972] Ephedrine and [phenylephrine] are still used to treat hypotension, but their use in other indications has decreased due to the development of more selective adrenergic agonists.[A193701,A193704,L12975] Ephedrine was granted a type 7 FDA Approval on 29 April 2016.[L12975]"
DB01367,Rasagiline is an irreversible inhibitor of monoamine oxidase and is used as a monotherapy in early Parkinson's disease or as an adjunct therapy in more advanced cases.
DB01378,"Magnesium hydroxide is used primarily in ""Milk of Magnesia"", a white aqueous, mildly alkaline suspension of magnesium hydroxide formulated at about 8%w/v. Milk of magnesia is primarily used to alleviate constipation, but can also be used to relieve indigestion and heartburn. When taken internally by mouth as a laxative, the osmotic force of the magnesia suspension acts to draw fluids from the body and to retain those already within the lumen of the intestine, serving to distend the bowel, thus stimulating nerves within the colon wall, inducing peristalsis and resulting in evacuation of colonic contents."
DB01394,"Colchicine is an alkaloid drug derived from a plant belonging to the Lily family, known as _Colchicum autumnale_, or ""autumn crocus.""[A183611] Its use was first approved by the FDA in 1961.[L8192] Colchicine is used in the treatment of gout flares and Familial Mediterranean fever,[L8138] and prevention of major cardiovascular events.[L47591] It has also been investigated in other inflammatory and fibrotic conditions.[A183602]"
DB01395,"Drospirenone is a synthetic progestin commonly found in the popular oral contraceptive, Yaz in combination with [Ethinyl estradiol].[L7973] Most recently, it was approved by both Health Canada and the FDA in combination with [Estetrol] as an oral contraceptive therapy.[L33199,L33174]  Aside from its contraceptive effects, drospirenone is used with estrogens to control acne and premenstrual dysphoric disorder (PMDD).

Drospirenone has been the subject of widespread safety concern due to the possibility of an increased risk of venous thromboembolism associated with its use.[A182543,A182552] In 2012, however, a safety statement by the FDA concluded that the increase in the risk of thromboembolism resulting from the use of drospirenone remains unclear, as studies regarding this risk are conflicting. Some studies have demonstrated a significantly increased risk and some demonstrating no risk of thromboembolic events.  In its statement, the FDA has mentioned that increased risk of venous thromboembolism with oral contraceptives such as drospirenone exists but remains lower than the risk of this condition during pregnancy and during the postpartum period, and this should be considered when assessing potential risks of hormonal contraceptive use.[L7979]"
DB01399,"Salsalate is a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent for oral administration. Salsalate's mode of action as an anti-inflammatory and antirheumatic agent may be due to inhibition of synthesis and release of prostaglandins. The usefulness of salicylic acid, the active in vivo product of salsalate, in the treatment of arthritic disorders has been established. In contrast to aspirin, salsalate causes no greater fecal gastrointestinal blood loss than placebo. Salsalate is readily soluble in the small intestine where it is partially hydrolyzed to two molecules of salicylic acid. A significant portion of the parent compound is absorbed unchanged and undergoes rapid esterase hydrolysis in the body. The parent compound has an elimination half-life of about 1 hour. Salicylic acid (the active metabolite) biotransformation is saturated at anti-inflammatory doses of salsalate. Such capacity limited biotransformation results in an increase in the half-life of salicylic acid from 3.5 to 16 or more hours."
DB01400,"A cholinesterase inhibitor used in the treatment of myasthenia gravis and to reverse the effects of muscle relaxants such as gallamine and tubocurarine. Neostigmine, unlike physostigmine, does not cross the blood-brain barrier."
DB01402,"Bismuth subsalicylate is an antacid and anti-diarrheal agent. Exhibiting antibacterial and gastroprotective properties, bismuth subsalicylate is an insoluble salt of salicylic acid linked to trivalent bismuth cation. Each molecule of bismuth subsalicylate contains 58% bismuth and 42% salicylate by weight. Bismuth subsalicylate has been around for over 100 years: it was originally developed in 1901 for hygienic use and sanitation for cholera infection.

Bismuth subsalicylate was first approved by the FDA in 1939 and is now mainly used to relieve nausea, diarrhea, and gastrointestinal discomfort. It is an active ingredient found in Pepto-Bismol, a common over-the-counter medication that is used to temporarily treat discomforts of the stomach and gastrointestinal tract. Bismuth subsalicylate is a component of HELIDAC Therapy (bismuth subsalicylate, metronidazole, and tetracycline), which is a treatment regimen indicated for the eradication of H. pylori for treatment of patients with H. pylori infection and duodenal ulcer disease."
